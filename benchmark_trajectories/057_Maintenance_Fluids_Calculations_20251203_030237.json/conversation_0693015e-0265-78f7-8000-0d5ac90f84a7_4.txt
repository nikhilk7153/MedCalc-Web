 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 10 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state. You can see this in your agent history when this happens.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions 
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step. 
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g. 
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
Be clear and concise in your decision-making. Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress. 
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.

PATIENT NOTE:
A 53-year-old, 56 kg weight and 154 cm height female was having pseudomyxoma peritonei, diffusely deposited in the abdomen and peritoneal surfaces as well as in the left lung and pleural space. She was a case of hypothyroidism since last 4 years on oral thyroxine 50 mcg once a day. Her laboratory investigations were within normal limits except that liver function test showed serum albumin of 2.1 g/L initially which improved to 3.4 g/L with high protein formula feed for 1-month period of evaluation and optimization. Preoperative electrocardiogram and 2D-echocardiogram were normal. Her effort tolerance was more than 4 METs. Preoperative pulmonary function test (PFT) showed FEV1 1.13 Litres (47.3% of predicted) with moderate restriction due to the lung metastases with small airway obstruction. Patient was started on bronchodilator therapy for the same. Diffusion capacity (DLCO) was 81% of predicted. A written informed consent was taken for surgery and anaesthesia. She was kept fasting for solid food for 8 hours. She received clear carbohydrate drink in previous evening and morning of surgery as per institutional protocol. In the operating room, ECG, non-invasive blood pressure and pulse oximetry were attached and base line parameters noted. A 16G intravenous cannula was secured and epidural catheter was placed in T7-8 interspace in left lateral position. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl (100 mcg), propofol (110 mg) and vecuronium (6mg) and was maintained on sevoflurane in a gaseous mixture of oxygen with nitrous oxide. The monitoring was then advanced to include invasive arterial blood pressure with pulse pressure variation (PPV), central venous pressure and monitoring with the help of FloTrac including cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume (SV), stroke volume index and stroke volume variation (SVV), as well as oesophageal temperature monitoring. CRS phase was started and total peritonectomy with total abdominal hysterectomy plus omenectomy, splenectomy, cholecystectomy and liver portal metastasis clearance was done. Bilateral diaphragmatic stripping was done for metastatic deposits. Debulking surgery of left thorax (large deposits over left lung) through left phrenotomy was done for pleural and lung PMP. A small part of left lower lobe was also resected. During debulking of thorax, a very low tidal volume (4 ml/kg) ventilation was started. CRS phase lasted for 12 hours with a total volume loss (blood mixed) during CRS phase was 6.5 liter, mostly constituted by jelly-like mucinous material. During abdominal debulking, fluid therapy was guided by PPV and SVV but after opening of pleura fluid therapy was guided by delta SV with optimum SV and target SV (10% less than optimum SV) calculation. Six units of packed red cells, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma and 500 ml of 20% albumin was given along with 6 liters of crystalloids and low dose (<0.1 μg/kg/min) nor-adrenaline support was needed toward end of CRS phase. Urine output target during CRS was more than 0.5 ml/kg/h. Total peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) was 39 with completion cytoreduction score of 1. HITAC in form of adriamycin 15 mg/m2 and mitomycin 15 mg/m2 was given in left side of thorax with open diaphragm and whole abdomen for 60 minutes with help of Belmont pump. A urine output of more than 2 ml/kg/h was targeted during HITAC phase by use of cold fluids. Temperature control was done with cold fluids at 6°C and ice packs on neck and axilla. The maximum temperature reached was 37.8°C after 40 minutes of starting HITAC. ScvO2 at end of CRS was 75.6% and at the end of HITAC phase it was 83.4%. Serum lactates increased from 1.10 mmol/L at the end of CRS phase to 8.02 mmol/L at the end of 60 minutes HITAC phase. Peak airway pressure increased from 23 to 30 cm of H2O during HITAC phase. At the end of procedure loop ileostomy was done and diaphragm was closed, drains were put in abdomen and bilateral chest tubes were placed and abdomen was closed. The patient maintained a moderate metabolic acidosis of pH 7.2-7.3 throughout the HITAC. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) mechanically ventilated and sedated. In the ICU, she was electively ventilated for 48 hours. The trachea was extubated on high flow nasal oxygenation by Optiflow™. On postoperative day (POD) 1, parenteral nutrition was started. Adequate pain relief was achieved by epidural infusion of local anaesthetic for 4 days along with intravenous paracetamol 1 g 6 hourly. She was shifted out from ICU on POD 7. PFT repeated on POD 13 showed severe restriction with small airway obstruction, FEV1 0.91 Liter (38% of predicted), and fall in DLCO from preoperative 81% to 59% in postoperative period. She was discharged from hospital on POD 15.

QUESTION:
Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?  You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.

CRITICAL RULES:
DO NOT calculate or compute the answer yourself, you MUST use the web calculator to get the answer.
Your answer will be marked as incorrect if you do this otherwise.

TASK:
1. Navigate to https://www.mdapp.co/iv-maintenance-fluids-calculator-307/
2. Read the patient note and extract the relevant clinical values
3. Fill out the ENTIRE calculator form with the values from the note
4. Click the Calculate button on the webpage
5. Wait for the result to appear on the page
6. Extract ONLY the numerical result that the CALCULATOR computed (not your own calculation)

IMPORTANT - Final Response Format:
After the calculator displays its result, return ONLY this JSON:
{"answer": <number_from_calculator>}

Examples:
- {"answer": 83.94}
- {"answer": 12}
- {"answer": 2.5}

The answer MUST be the value the web calculator computed, NOT a value you calculated yourself.

	Variables and formula
	This calculator determines the fluid requirement that needs to be corrected in pediatric patients based on weight (because total body water relies on weight). There are two calculation methods used, the Holliday-Segar nomogram and the 4 – 2 – 1 rule.
	The main limitation of the calculator is that it cannot be applied to newborns (the first 28 days after full term pregnancy) or to any infant weighing less than 3.5 kg.
	The rule of thumb in water loss (and water requirement) is that hospitalized patients require approximately 100 mL/ 100 kcal/day, to replace insensible and urinary water loss.
	The first calculation method uses the Holliday-Segar Nomogram guidelines to determine the Daily Volume, as introduced in the table below:
	Patient weight (kg)
	Fluid maintenance
	3.5 - 10
	100 mL/kg
	(>) 10 – 20
	100 mL/kg for the first 10 kg, then 50 mL for each kg past 10 kg
	(>) 20 - 65
	1500 mL plus 20 mL for each kg past 20 kg
	>65
	2,400 mL
	The fluid rate in mL/hr can then be calculated as Daily volume / 24.
	The 4 – 2 – 1 rule is based on the following:
	Patient weight (kg)
	Fluid Maintenance (by 4-2-1 rule)
	3.5 - 10
	4 mL/hr for each kg
	(>) 10 – 20
	4 mL/hr for each of the first 10 kg, then 2 mL/hr for each kg past 10 kg
	(>) 20 - 65
	60 mL/hr plus 1 mL/hr for each kg past 20 kg
	>65
	105 mL/hr
	The fluid replenishment recommended by the calculator needs to be adapted by clinicians based on the past, current and prospective hydration status of the patient.
	Cases of under dosing may result in continuing the dehydration and can lead to renal insufficiency. If overdosed, the patient may develop edema or fluid overload.
	In case the pediatric patient suffers from a renal condition or is a patient with burns, the above methods may not be sufficient.
	About maintenance fluid therapy
	When the body cannot preserve the normal volume of fluids and the electrolyte balance, fluid replenishment becomes necessary to ensure homeostasis and to make sure cardiac output is optimized.
	Total water loss is broken into three components:
	■ Respiratory loss: 20%;
	■ Transcutaneous loss: 30%;
	■ Urine: 50%.
	The ongoing losses of water and electrolytes due to physiologic processes (respiration, sweat, urine and stool) are to be replenished first and then the deficits caused by illnesses and physiologic abnormalities are addressed.
	There are three types of circumstances that influence intravascular fluid balance:
	■ Preoperative;
	■ Intraoperative;
	■ Postoperative.
	In febrile children there is a higher transcutaneous evaporative water loss which leads to rapid dehydration. The most common cause of dehydration in pediatric patient remains diarrheal fluid loss, which contributes to electrolyte loss (diarhea varying from isotonic to hypo-osmolar).
