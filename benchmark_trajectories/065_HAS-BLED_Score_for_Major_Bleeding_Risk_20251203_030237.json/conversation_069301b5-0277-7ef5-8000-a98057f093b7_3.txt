 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 10 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state. You can see this in your agent history when this happens.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions 
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step. 
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g. 
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
Be clear and concise in your decision-making. Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress. 
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.

PATIENT NOTE:
A 70-year-old woman came to the electrophysiology follow-up clinic at her referring internist’s request to re-evaluate long-term oral anticoagulation in the setting of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation that had first been identified on a routine pre-operative ECG sixteen months ago. Since that time she has been taking warfarin, but she relates considerable difficulty maintaining a steady anticoagulation intensity: during the past half-year her home INR log supplied by the anticoagulation service shows values swinging from 1.6 to 4.1 despite dose adjustments, and she recalls two telephone calls from the clinic instructing her to hold doses and repeat testing because the value was above the therapeutic window. She denies ever needing reversal agents, hospital admission, transfusion, endoscopy, or surgical intervention for hemorrhage, but she does remember a prolonged gingival ooze after a dental cleaning three months earlier and a self-limited superficial epistaxis episode after using a home humidifier in winter. She has never experienced black or bloody stools, hematemesis, hematuria, or bruising large enough to raise concern. Her medical history is otherwise notable for well-controlled type 2 diabetes managed with metformin 500 mg twice daily, dyslipidemia treated with atorvastatin 20 mg nightly, postmenopausal osteoporosis for which she takes weekly alendronate, seasonal allergic rhinitis controlled with nasal corticosteroid spray, and remote nicotine dependence; she smoked one pack per day for twenty years but quit fifteen years ago. She has never been told she has high blood pressure, and serial printouts from her community pharmacy’s automated cuff over the past year show systolic readings consistently in the 110s-120s mm Hg range, with today’s seated manual measurement 123/74 mm Hg and a heart rate of 78 beats per minute that is irregularly irregular. She denies transient ischemic attack, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, carotid disease, or peripheral embolic events. She has no personal history of chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcohol-related liver injury, or jaundice; a comprehensive metabolic panel drawn last week for her primary care visit documented AST 24 U/L, ALT 26 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 68 U/L, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, and albumin 4.2 g/dL. Kidney function has been unremarkable, with a stable creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL and estimated glomerular filtration rate of 68 mL/min/1.73 m²; she has never had nephrolithiasis, proteinuric disorders, or dialytic therapy. She is not taking antiplatelet agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or herbal supplements known to increase bleeding tendency; for episodic knee discomfort from old athletic injuries she uses acetaminophen 650 mg as needed, typically twice a week. She denies a family history of hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, aneurysms, or premature sudden death. Review of systems today is negative for chest pain, dyspnea at rest, exertional intolerance, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, abdominal pain, early satiety, pruritus, overt ascites, confusion, or peripheral edema. She remains physically active, walking her dog two miles most mornings and participating in low-impact aerobics at the community center. Socially she lives with her spouse and enjoys a nightly glass or two of white wine with dinner, plus a couple of champagne mimosas during Sunday brunch, amounting to roughly ten alcoholic drinks each week; she does not use recreational drugs and only drinks coffee otherwise. On examination she is well appearing with a body mass index of 26 kg/m², afebrile, and breathing comfortably. Cardiac auscultation reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops; jugular venous pressure is not elevated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, nontender, and without organomegaly or palpable masses. There is no scleral icterus, telangiectasia, spider nevi, palmar erythema, or digital clubbing. Extremities show no edema, petechiae, ecchymoses, or palpable purpura, and peripheral pulses are full and symmetric. Neurologic screening exam demonstrates intact cranial nerves, normal motor strength and tone, and no cerebellar signs. Laboratory tests drawn immediately before the visit reveal hemoglobin 13.4 g/dL, hematocrit 40%, platelets 232 × 10⁹/L, white blood cell count 6.1 × 10⁹/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.1 mmol/L, and INR 1.8. A twelve-lead electrocardiogram obtained in the office shows atrial fibrillation with an average ventricular rate of 76/min, normal QRS axis and duration, and no acute ST-T abnormalities. A transthoracic echocardiogram performed three months earlier indicated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, normal right ventricular size and function, mild left atrial enlargement, trivial mitral regurgitation, and no intracardiac thrombus. She expresses interest in learning whether continuing warfarin, switching to a direct oral anticoagulant, or considering rhythm control strategies would best balance her desire to avoid both stroke and future bleeding episodes as she plans international travel later this year.

	HAS-BLED Score = 5
	Interpretation:
	This score indicates a
	9.10% risk of major bleeding within 1 year in patients with atrial fibrillation
	. The score should be taken in consideration when initiating oral anticoagulation therapy or aspirin intake.
	Disclaimer:
	This tool should NOT be considered as a substitute for any professional medical service, NOR as a substitute for clinical judgement. Please read the

	The scoring system explained
	This score is recommended in the assessment of patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation in order to stratify bleeding risk, before anticoagulation therapy is initiated.
	A major bleeding event requires hospitalization, involves a haemoglobin decrease of more than 2 g/L and intracranial bleeding and may require transfusion.
	The score is named after the criteria assessed, which can be found in the table below:
	HAS-BLED item
	Description
	Hypertension history
	Systolic blood pressure above 160 mmHg and not under treatment.
	Renal disease
	Creatinine values higher than 2.6 mg/dL (200 mmol/L).
	Liver disease
	Bilirubin two times higher than normal or AST/ALT/AP three times higher than normal. Patient under dialysis, transplant, abnormal hepatic function or chronic hepatic disease.
	Stroke history
	Family or personal history of vascular events provoked or unprovoked.
	History of major bleeding or predisposition
	The predisposition is based on clinical data or because of treatment with antiplatelet agents, NSAIDs etc.
	Labile INR – high values
	Unstable or very high INRs with a time in therapeutic range of less than 60%.
	Age higher than 65
	Elderly patients are at higher risk of bleeding.
	Under medication that predisposes to bleeding.
	Patient is under anticoagulation therapy (e.g. Warfarin).
	Alcohol or drug usage history
	More than 7 drinks per week.
	This model has been criticised for not providing a risk category (such as low, medium or high) alongside the risk percentage.
	There are other risk stratification tools, such as the CHADS2, that can be used to weight the benefits and risks of anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.
	Score interpretation
	The score results vary from 0 to 9 and are associated with a 1-year bleeding risk percentage:
	Score
	Risk of major bleeding
	1.10%
	3.40%
	4.10%
	5.80%
	8.90%
	9.10%
	≥6
	Higher %
	The recommendation is that any patient scoring higher than 3 should be clinically monitored regularly after the oral anticoagulation therapy is initiated.
	Scores of 6 and above are considered to be exceptions and are often not considered in studies. Their associated bleeding risk is considerably higher than that of a 5 score, which is 9.10%.
	About the study
	The score was created by
	*[1620]<a />
		Pisters
	et al. in 2010, following a study on 3,978 patients from the Euro Heart Survey. These patients were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and a complete follow up plus multivariate analysis on potential bleeding risk factors was performed.
	53 major bleeding events occurred during the 1-year follow up period and the annual bleeding rate increased with increasing risk factors.
	The score showed consistent predictive accuracy in several subgroups of the study.
	The bleeding score created, the HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly (>65 years), Drugs/alcohol concomitantly), showed that there is a direct link between the presence and severity of the risk factors and the increase in major bleeding events.
