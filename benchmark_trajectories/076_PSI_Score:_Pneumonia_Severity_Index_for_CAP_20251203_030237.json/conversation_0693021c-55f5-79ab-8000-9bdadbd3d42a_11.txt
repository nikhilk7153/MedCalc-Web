 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 10 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state. You can see this in your agent history when this happens.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions 
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step. 
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g. 
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
Be clear and concise in your decision-making. Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress. 
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.
</reasoning_rules>

PATIENT NOTE:
A 75-year-old female arrived at the emergency department describing four days of progressive respiratory discomfort that worsened considerably in the last 24 hours. She reported having felt slightly chilled on and off, yet only noted a mild elevation in her temperature when she checked it at home, which was confirmed on arrival as moderately above her usual baseline, though not strikingly high at 37.6 degrees Celsius. She indicated that her coughing, which began as an intermittent irritation, gradually intensified and was now accompanied by minimal sputum production. Though she did not appear confused or disoriented during the interview, she mentioned being more fatigued than usual, finding simple household activities taxing. She has resided independently for many years, taking care of her daily needs without ongoing assistance, and specifically noted living in her own house rather than a supervised environment. She claimed no further limitations except for occasionally reduced stamina related to a neurological event in her past, which she said caused transient weakness and difficulty with coordination several years earlier. According to her recollection, careful management and rehabilitation helped her regain much of her functionality, but she still routinely follows up with her physician to ensure there are no late complications. She also recalled a longstanding concern involving her liver that once led her to attend specialized evaluations, though she did not elaborate extensively on the details aside from stating that she has to be mindful of potential side effects when prescribed new medications. She denied significant cardiac difficulties that would require regular attention for fluid management and has experienced no episodes of fluid accumulation in her extremities or lungs that might point to a chronic heart condition; she insisted her heart rate fluctuations are typically mild. On examination, she was alert, cooperative, and oriented to time, place, and situation, with no lapse in her current mental clarity. Her breathing, however, caught the attention of the clinical team, given that her rate of inspirations was measured at 15 per minute, which was within an acceptable range but did not match the degree of subjective discomfort she reported. Her pulse was notably elevated at 105 beats per minute, though its rhythm was regular. Documentation of her systolic blood pressure revealed a value of 114 mm Hg, consistent with a mildly reduced level for her typical readings but not acutely alarming. Laboratory results obtained prior to any intervention provided further insight into her presentation. A test gauging her systemic acid-base status returned a reading of 7.32, suggesting a shift toward acidity that merited continued observation and possible additional studies to determine the cause. Her oxygenation status, measured in an arterial sample, showed a partial pressure of 74 mm Hg, which aligned with her subjective complaints of difficulty taking a full breath and feeling winded after minimal exertion. A renal function indicator remained within a reasonable range at 17 mg/dL, and she experienced no known deficits in her kidney output or filtration capacity, stating that her urine production and serum chemistry have generally stayed stable at her routine checkups. An electrolyte panel signaled that her serum sodium was on the higher end, with a measurement of 148 mEq/L, prompting the team to consider her hydration status and dietary intake. Additional labs revealed that her red blood cell concentration was at 50%, a figure that did not appear to compromise her oxygen-carrying capacity, and her serum glucose reading of 114 mg/dL appeared mildly above average but not indicative of a significant metabolic disturbance.nRadiographic imaging of her thorax displayed evidence of infection, along with a collection of fluid located around one lung field, which was consistent with the findings of dullness to percussion and altered breath sounds on physical examination. This fluid accumulation raised the possibility of complications related to her acute presentation, though she did not endorse any known chronic processes that typically result in recurrent fluid build-up in the pleural space. She recalled no abrupt changes to her usual patterns of activity besides progressive shortness of breath over the past several days, indicating that she continued performing the majority of her daily routines before feeling forced to seek medical attention for this escalating respiratory distress. She reiterated that she had no recent hospital admissions or major interventions, and her prior physician visits revolved around regular follow-up evaluations of her past neurological issue and intermittent monitoring of her liver status. Despite the significant respiratory findings, she did not exhibit confusion, speech difficulties, or notable lapses in memory during evaluation, steadily maintaining awareness of her situation. Given her advanced age and the multiple considerations posed by her past medical history, the clinical team determined that her symptoms, exam findings, and laboratory results warranted further in-hospital workup. Her stable but not entirely reassuring vital signs were taken into account before deciding on any acute therapy, ensuring that every relevant baseline measure was documented and understood prior to initiating treatment.

QUESTION:
What is the patient's Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.

CRITICAL RULES:
DO NOT calculate or compute the answer yourself, you MUST use the web calculator to get the answer.
Your answer will be marked as incorrect if you do this otherwise.

TASK:
1. Navigate to https://www.mdapp.co/pneumonia-severity-index-psi-calculator-247/
2. Read the patient note and extract the relevant clinical values
3. Fill out the ENTIRE calculator form with the values from the note
4. Click the Calculate button on the webpage
5. Wait for the result to appear on the page
6. Extract ONLY the numerical result that the CALCULATOR computed (not your own calculation)

IMPORTANT - Final Response Format:
After the calculator displays its result, return ONLY this JSON:
{"answer": <number_from_calculator>}

Examples:
- {"answer": 83.94}
- {"answer": 12}
- {"answer": 2.5}

The answer MUST be the value the web calculator computed, NOT a value you calculated yourself.
