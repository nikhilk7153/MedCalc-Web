 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 10 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state. You can see this in your agent history when this happens.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions 
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step. 
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g. 
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
Be clear and concise in your decision-making. Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress. 
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.

PATIENT NOTE:
A 63-year-old female who was visitor from Veracruz, Mexico, presented to the emergency room with complaints of progressively worsening abdominal pain and distention for three days. She also had fever and altered mentation. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and end-stage renal disease. She had been on PD for four years and denied any recent changes in technique. She had two episodes of peritonitis in the past while in Mexico but was unaware of the details of those episodes. Her surgical history was significant for appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and tubal ligation and she denied any recent abdominal procedure. She denied smoking, alcohol intake, or use of recreational drugs.
On examination, her blood pressure was 172/85 mm of Hg, pulse 88/min, oral temperature 39.5°C (103.1°F), respiratory rate 14/min, and oxygen saturation on room air 94%. She was lethargic and confused. She had abdominal distention and diffuse tenderness without any rebound or guarding. Her PD catheter exit site was clean and dry. Laboratory studies showed white blood cell count of 14.5 × 103/μL with 87.1% granulocytes, hemoglobin of 6.3 g/dL, and hematocrit of 18.4%. Serum chemistries showed sodium of 130 mmol/L, potassium of 2.7 mmol/L, chloride of 90 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 27 mmol/L, blood urine nitrogen of 30 mg/dL, and creatinine of 7.7 mg/dL. Her liver function tests were within normal limits. Computed tomography of abdomen and pelvis without intravenous or oral contrast showed peritoneal thickening consistent with peritonitis, and there was no evidence of perforation or obstruction (). PD fluid analysis showed white cell count of 2173 per mm3 with 96% neutrophils and red blood cells of <3000 per mm3.
Blood and PD fluid cultures were sent, and she was empirically treated for bacterial peritonitis with intraperitoneal cefazolin and ceftazidime. PD fluid gram stain revealed budding yeast; blood and PD fluid cultures did not reveal bacterial growth. Given the high suspicion of fungal peritonitis, immediate removal of the PD catheter was discussed with the patient. She chose not to have the catheter removed, leave to Mexico, and get treated by her own nephrologist. Hence oral fluconazole was started for presumed Candida peritonitis. However, six days later, the fungal culture [Mycosel Agar and Brain Heart Infusion Agar] of the PD fluid grew H. Capsulatum.

QUESTION:
Using the MDRD GFR Equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? If the patient is black, please use the MDRD GFR Equation for Blacks. You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.

CRITICAL RULES:
DO NOT calculate or compute the answer yourself, you MUST use the web calculator to get the answer.
Your answer will be marked as incorrect if you do this otherwise.

TASK:
1. Navigate to https://www.mdapp.co/mdrd-calculator-320/
2. Read the patient note and extract the relevant clinical values
3. Fill out the ENTIRE calculator form with the values from the note
4. Click the Calculate button on the webpage
5. Wait for the result to appear on the page
6. Extract ONLY the numerical result that the CALCULATOR computed (not your own calculation)

IMPORTANT - Final Response Format:
After the calculator displays its result, return ONLY this JSON:
{"answer": <number_from_calculator>}

Examples:
- {"answer": 83.94}
- {"answer": 12}
- {"answer": 2.5}

The answer MUST be the value the web calculator computed, NOT a value you calculated yourself.

	MDRD method explained
	The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula determines the estimated glomerular filtration rate which offers information about the overall function of the kidneys in adults.
	The parameters required for calculation include:
	■ Serum creatinine – measured in mg/dL;
	■ Patient age – where the higher the age, the greater the risk of irregular kidney function;
	■ Patient gender – the MDRD formula accounts for gender difference;
	■ Patient race – African American people tend to have a greater GFR than Caucasian people at similar serum creatinine levels meaning adjustments are required.
	In 1999,
	[1292]<a />
		Levey
	et al. came with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula:
	eGFR = 175 x (Serum Creatinine)
	-1.154
	x (Age)
	-0.203
	x (0.742 only if female) x (1.212 only if black)
	The above formula can only be used in estimating GFR in stable chronic kidney disease and is not addressed to patients with acute renal failure. The method has been validated and has shown better correlation than other GFR estimation calculations, such as the Cockcroft-Gault formula.
	The Working Group set the upper reporting limit at 90 mL/min/1.73 m
	, meaning that all values above this threshold should be referred to as "> 90 mL/min/1.73 m2" rather than directly specified.
	In terms of age related normal values, for patients aged 70 and above, eGFR values of 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m
	are considered typical when in the absence of kidney damage signs and when unrelated to chronic kidney disease-related complications.
	The second tab of the calculator offers an estimation of GFR that can be used for pediatric patients, based on serum creatinine and height, the former helping to determine the body surface area.
	GFR guidelines
	GFR estimation provides insight into the basic renal function without the need of invasive investigations. The results obtained are adapted for a standard body surface area of 1.73 m
	Glomerular filtration rate represents the amount of blood filtered by the capillaries of the kidney into the Bowman capsules (filtration and elimination of toxins in urine) in a certain amount on time.
	GFR values above 90 mL/min/1.73 m
	are considered normal in the absence of any kidney disease evidence.

 user 
You failed 3 times. Therefore we terminate the agent.
Your only tool available is the "done" tool. No other tool is available. All other tools which you see in history or examples are not available.
If the task is not yet fully finished as requested by the user, set success in "done" to false! E.g. if not all steps are fully completed. Else success to true.
Include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text.

  "evaluation_previous_goal": "Previous attempts opened the MDRD calculator page and populated form fields, but I did not obtain or extract the calculator's numerical result (failure).",
  "memory": "I opened the MDRD MDRD calculator page (https://www.mdapp.co/mdrd-calculator-320/) in tab D24F and confirmed the form fields (serum creatinine, age, gender, race, Calculate button) are present with interactive element indexes [44],[45],[46],[47],[70]. Patient admission values available: creatinine 7.7 mg/dL, age 63, female, race White/Other (visitor from Veracruz). Multiple attempts to input and extract the result produced JSON validation errors and no final numeric output was captured.",

        "text": "Summary of actions and findings:\n\n- Goal: Use the MDRD web calculator at https://www.mdapp.co/mdrd-calculator-320/ to compute the MDRD GFR for the patient described and return only the numeric calculator output in JSON form.\n\n- Patient admission values (extracted from the provided clinical note):\n  - Serum creatinine: 7.7 mg/dL\n  - Age: 63 years\n  - Gender: Female\n  - Race: White/Other (patient is a visitor from Veracruz, Mexico; use White/Other unless specified as Black)\n  - Timing: Values to be used are those on initial admission prior to treatment.\n\n- What I did in the browser:\n  - Opened a new tab and navigated to: https://www.mdapp.co/mdrd-calculator-320/ (tab D24F).\n  - Confirmed the calculator page loaded and read page content and form presence (visible on screenshot and in interactive element list).\n  - Identified interactive elements for the form fields: serum creatinine input [44], age input [45], gender select [46], race select [47], Calculate button [70].\n  - Attempted to fill the form with the admission values (creatinine 7.7, age 63, gender Female, race White/Other) and click Calculate. Several attempts were made as recorded in agent history.\n\n- What went wrong / why the task is incomplete:\n  - Although the page was opened and form fields are visible, the automated attempts to input values and extract the resulting numeric GFR value did not produce a captured calculator output. The agent history shows repeated JSON/validation errors after attempts, and no final numeric result was returned from the page.\n  - The user has now terminated the agent and instructed that only the done tool is available.\n\n- Current state and what remains undone:\n  - The MDRD calculator page is open and ready with the form available at indexes noted above, and the correct clinical values have been identified.\n  - The critical required final step — clicking Calculate and extracting the numerical result produced by the web calculator — was not successfully completed and therefore the required numeric answer from the web calculator was not captured.\n\nConclusion and required next steps if resumed:\n  - To complete the user's requested task (and comply with the rule to NOT compute manually), an agent must fill the form on https://www.mdapp.co/mdrd-calculator-320/ with the admission values (creatinine 7.7, age 63, female, White/Other), click Calculate, wait for the page to render the result, and extract ONLY the numeric GFR value returned by the calculator.\n  - Because the numeric result was not obtained before termination, I must mark this attempt as unsuccessful.\n\nStatus:\n- success: false\n\nIf you want me to try again (resume the web interaction), please re-enable the agent/tools and I will: open the calculator page, populate the form explicitly using the interactive indexes, click Calculate, wait for the result, and return the calculator's numeric output in the exact JSON format you requested (e.g., {\"answer\": 12.34}).",
