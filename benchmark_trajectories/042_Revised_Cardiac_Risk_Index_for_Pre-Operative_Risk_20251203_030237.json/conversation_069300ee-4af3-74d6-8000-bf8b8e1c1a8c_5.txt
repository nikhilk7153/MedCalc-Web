 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 10 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state. You can see this in your agent history when this happens.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions 
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step. 
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g. 
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
Be clear and concise in your decision-making. Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress. 
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.

PATIENT NOTE:
A 62-year-old woman presented to the pre-operative medicine clinic three weeks before a scheduled elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. She had been referred by her general surgeon for a comprehensive assessment to optimize medical conditions prior to anesthesia. The patient reported that the biliary colic began approximately eight months earlier and had grown progressively more frequent, prompting the decision for surgery; the operation is planned as a minimally invasive abdominal procedure expected to last under two hours and is not considered particularly hazardous from a cardiovascular standpoint. Past medical history is notable for long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus first diagnosed at age 38. Glycemic control at home relies on a multiple daily injection regimen consisting of basal glargine each night and rapid-acting insulin lispro before meals; she meticulously records glucose values, with most recent self-monitoring logs showing fasting readings in the 110–140 mg/dL range. There is also well-controlled essential hypertension treated with lisinopril 20 mg daily and low-dose hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg each morning. She has hyperlipidemia managed with atorvastatin 40 mg nightly, with a last LDL of 82 mg/dL six months ago. She denies ever experiencing angina, exertional chest tightness, radiation of discomfort to the arm or jaw, or rest pain. She has never been hospitalized for heart-related shortness of breath, fluid overload, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower-extremity edema and has never required diuretics beyond those for blood pressure control. There is no personal history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, carotid artery surgery, or focal neurologic deficits. She has never undergone percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass, or peripheral vascular revascularization. Her exercise tolerance is reasonably good; she walks her dog briskly for 30 minutes daily, climbs two flights of stairs without pausing, and gardens without symptoms. She has no chronic lung disease, takes no inhalers, and has never smoked. Family history reveals a father with myocardial infarction at 72 and a mother with type 2 diabetes; no premature cardiac or cerebrovascular events are reported. She consumes a glass of wine with dinner on weekends and denies illicit drug use. Allergies include a pruritic rash with sulfa antibiotics. Review of systems is negative for palpitations, syncope, orthopnea, nocturnal cough, claudication, or visual disturbances. On examination, she appears well and in no distress, body mass index 31 kg/m². Blood pressure is 132/78 mm Hg in the right arm, heart rate 78 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate 14 breaths/min, temperature 36.8 °C, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Jugular venous pressure is not elevated; carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits. Cardiac auscultation reveals a normal S1 and S2 with no gallops, murmurs, or rubs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft with mild right upper quadrant tenderness but no guarding or rebound. Extremities show no peripheral edema, pulses are 2+ and symmetric. Neurologic examination demonstrates full strength, intact sensation, and normal gait. Laboratory studies obtained the same morning include a basic metabolic panel demonstrating serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 14 mg/dL, sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.3 mmol/L, chloride 102 mmol/L, bicarbonate 26 mmol/L, and glucose 172 mg/dL. Complete blood count is unremarkable with hemoglobin 13.1 g/dL, hematocrit 39.4%, platelets 256 × 10⁹/L, and white blood cell count 6.3 × 10⁹/L. Liver function tests show AST 34 U/L, ALT 30 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 122 U/L, and total bilirubin 1.3 mg/dL. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein and thyroid-stimulating hormone are within reference ranges. Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm at 76 beats/min with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities and a corrected QT of 420 ms. A resting two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram performed by her primary cardiologist two months earlier for a new-patient evaluation demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, normal chamber sizes, and no valvular stenosis or regurgitation of more than mild degree. She is currently taking lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, atorvastatin, and her insulin injections; no beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or antiplatelet agents are prescribed. She fasted overnight before laboratory testing and has not yet begun any peri-operative antibiotics or anticoagulants. The anesthesiology service has reviewed her airway and anticipates no difficulty with intubation. She has been counseled on continuing her usual evening basal insulin with a modest dose reduction the night before surgery and holding rapid-acting insulin on the morning of the procedure while checking point-of-care glucose on arrival to the pre-operative holding area. Updated vaccinations, including influenza and pneumococcal, are current. She understands the plan and agrees to proceed with elective cholecystectomy.

	RCRI explained
	This Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) helps in the evaluation of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
	It estimates the likelihood of perioperative cardiac events and therefore can support clinical decision making as to the benefits and risks surgery has over other treatment options that might be available for individual cases.
	The criteria considered in the RCRI is discussed below:
	1. High-Risk Surgery
	- Intraperitoneal;
	- Intrathoracic;
	- Suprainguinal vascular.
	The first criteria checks whether the patient is undergoing any of the above types of surgery, which are considered to have a higher risk of subsequent perioperative cardiac complications.
	2. History of ischemic heart disease
	Patient history which is proven through history positive test, diagnosed MI, the patient under nitrate therapy, current chest pain suspicion of myocardial ischemia or evidence of pathological Q waves on electrocardiogram.
	3. History of congestive heart failure
	- Pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop;
	- Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea;
	- CXR showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
	The presence of any of the above three symptoms indicates history of CHF.
	4. History of cerebrovascular disease
	- Prior TIA or stroke.
	5. Pre-operative insulin treatment.
	6. Pre-operative creatinine more than 2 mg/dL.
	This signals presence of chronic kidney disease.
	The RCRI refers to the following conditions as major cardiac events or complications:
	■ Myocardial infarction;
	■ Ventricular fibrillation;
	■ Primary cardiac arrest;
	■ Pulmonary edema;
	■ Complete heart block.
	The RCRI and programs such as the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) cater for cardiac surgery complications, but there are other evaluations that deal with cardiac risk arising from noncardiac surgery.
	Myocardial infarction and heart failure are common causes of morbidity and mortality in any type of serious surgery.
	Similarly, the spectrum of peri and post-operative complications does not end with cardiac events, as other complications such as coagulopathy, cerebrovascular disease or anemia can occur.
