 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 10 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state. You can see this in your agent history when this happens.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions 
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step. 
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g. 
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
Be clear and concise in your decision-making. Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress. 
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.

PATIENT NOTE:
A 53-year-old man was seen in the subspecialty arrhythmia clinic to review his chronic oral anticoagulation in the setting of paroxysmal non-valvular atrial fibrillation detected eight months earlier during an urgent care visit for sudden palpitations. Four months before that arrhythmia was discovered, he experienced an embolic left parietal ischemic stroke documented on magnetic resonance imaging; a brief inpatient course of intravenous heparin was transitioned to warfarin at discharge, and he completed a structured rehabilitation program with full recovery of speech and motor function. Since initiation of warfarin his community pharmacy–based service has logged weekly international normalized ratios between 2.2 and 2.6 with no dose interruptions, vitamin K rescues, or emergency evaluations, yielding a calculated time in therapeutic range greater than 75 %. He brings printouts of the past twelve INR checks that confirm this consistency. The patient’s medical history is otherwise notable for biopsy-proven non-alcoholic steatohepatitis that evolved three years ago into compensated cirrhosis; the most recent comprehensive metabolic panel, drawn one week prior to today’s visit, demonstrated alanine aminotransferase 68 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 74 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 136 U/L, total bilirubin 1.9 mg/dL, albumin 3.4 g/dL, and international normalized ratio 2.4 on his usual dose, with platelet count 142 × 10⁹/L. He has never manifested ascites, encephalopathy, variceal hemorrhage, or peripheral edema, yet hepatology follows him semi-annually and he underwent screening upper endoscopy six months ago that showed only mild portal hypertensive gastropathy without varices. He denies any kidney problems, and outpatient laboratory records over the past year list serum creatinine values between 0.8 and 0.9 mg/dL with estimated glomerular filtration rates consistently above 90 mL/min/1.73 m². Home blood-pressure readings provided on his smartphone average 116/74 mm Hg, and today’s seated manual measurement after five minutes of rest is 118/72 mm Hg with a pulse that is irregularly irregular at 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate 14 per minute, temperature 36.7 °C, and oxygen saturation 97 % on ambient air. Because of the prior cerebrovascular event his neurologist added enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg daily for antiplatelet synergy, and for chronic right knee osteoarthritis he self-administers over-the-counter ibuprofen 400 mg two or three times per week, most recently yesterday after mowing the lawn. Mood disorder screening several years ago led to initiation of sertraline 50 mg each morning, a regimen he continues. He is otherwise not taking clopidogrel, dipyridamole, corticosteroids, herbal supplements, or over-the-counter preparations marketed for “natural blood thinning.” He works full-time as an accountant, swims three mornings per week, and lives with his spouse; they are childless. Social history reveals he stopped smoking cigarettes a decade ago after a 12-pack-year exposure and denies recreational drug use. Regarding alcohol, he candidly reports drinking two pints of craft beer after work on most weekdays and four or five mixed drinks while socializing on Saturday evenings, amounting to approximately 24 alcoholic beverages each week; he acknowledges occasional weekend binges in the past but states he now spaces consumption evenly. Review of systems today is negative for epistaxis, gingival bleeding, hematuria, melena, hematochezia, easy bruising, light-headedness, jaundice progression, abdominal distension, pruritus, confusion, chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, leg swelling, visual disturbance, or new neurologic deficits. Physical examination shows an alert, well-nourished man with body mass index 26 kg/m², anicteric sclerae with only faint conjunctival injection, moist oral mucosa without petechiae, supple neck without jugular venous distention, clear lung fields, a nondisplaced apical impulse, variable S1 intensity without murmurs or extra sounds, and a soft, mildly enlarged liver palpable 2 cm below the costal margin but nontender; no splenomegaly, shifting dullness, or caput medusae are detected. Skin inspection reveals no spider angiomata, ecchymoses, or purpura, and distal pulses are intact. Neurologic screening demonstrates normal cranial nerves, full strength, and steady gait. A 12-lead electrocardiogram performed in clinic confirms atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response at 80 beats per minute and no acute ST-T abnormalities. Point-of-care hemoglobin is 14.1 g/dL and platelet count, as noted above, is 142 × 10⁹/L. The patient wishes to discuss whether remaining on warfarin, switching to a direct oral anticoagulant, or exploring a left atrial appendage occlusion would provide the most favorable balance between ischemic stroke prevention and hemorrhagic risk in light of his liver condition, concurrent use of agents that can impair hemostasis, and substantial alcohol intake; he expresses a commitment to maintaining stable weight, moderating beverage consumption, coordinating with hepatology on beta-blocker prophylaxis if portal pressure rises, and continuing meticulous home monitoring of blood pressure while shared decision-making proceeds.

QUESTION:
What is the patient's HAS-BLED score? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.

CRITICAL RULES:
DO NOT calculate or compute the answer yourself, you MUST use the web calculator to get the answer.
Your answer will be marked as incorrect if you do this otherwise.

TASK:
1. Navigate to https://www.mdapp.co/has-bled-score-calculator-155/
2. Read the patient note and extract the relevant clinical values
3. Fill out the ENTIRE calculator form with the values from the note
4. Click the Calculate button on the webpage
5. Wait for the result to appear on the page
6. Extract ONLY the numerical result that the CALCULATOR computed (not your own calculation)

IMPORTANT - Final Response Format:
After the calculator displays its result, return ONLY this JSON:
{"answer": <number_from_calculator>}

Examples:
- {"answer": 83.94}
- {"answer": 12}
- {"answer": 2.5}

The answer MUST be the value the web calculator computed, NOT a value you calculated yourself.

	The scoring system explained
	This score is recommended in the assessment of patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation in order to stratify bleeding risk, before anticoagulation therapy is initiated.
	A major bleeding event requires hospitalization, involves a haemoglobin decrease of more than 2 g/L and intracranial bleeding and may require transfusion.
	The score is named after the criteria assessed, which can be found in the table below:
	HAS-BLED item
	Description
	Hypertension history
	Systolic blood pressure above 160 mmHg and not under treatment.
	Renal disease
	Creatinine values higher than 2.6 mg/dL (200 mmol/L).
	Liver disease
	Bilirubin two times higher than normal or AST/ALT/AP three times higher than normal. Patient under dialysis, transplant, abnormal hepatic function or chronic hepatic disease.
	Stroke history
	Family or personal history of vascular events provoked or unprovoked.
	History of major bleeding or predisposition
	The predisposition is based on clinical data or because of treatment with antiplatelet agents, NSAIDs etc.
	Labile INR – high values
	Unstable or very high INRs with a time in therapeutic range of less than 60%.
	Age higher than 65
	Elderly patients are at higher risk of bleeding.
	Under medication that predisposes to bleeding.
	Patient is under anticoagulation therapy (e.g. Warfarin).
	Alcohol or drug usage history
	More than 7 drinks per week.
	This model has been criticised for not providing a risk category (such as low, medium or high) alongside the risk percentage.
	There are other risk stratification tools, such as the CHADS2, that can be used to weight the benefits and risks of anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.
	Score interpretation
	The score results vary from 0 to 9 and are associated with a 1-year bleeding risk percentage:
	Score
	Risk of major bleeding
	1.10%
	3.40%
