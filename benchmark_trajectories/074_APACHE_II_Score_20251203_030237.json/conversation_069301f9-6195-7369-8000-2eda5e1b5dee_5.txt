 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 10 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state. You can see this in your agent history when this happens.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions 
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step. 
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g. 
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
Be clear and concise in your decision-making. Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress. 
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.

PATIENT NOTE:
A 74-year-old male was brought to the intensive care unit with a high fever, respiratory difficulty, and marked lethargy that raised immediate concerns about a serious ongoing process. He had a known vulnerability regarding his body’s defense mechanisms, placing him at risk for severe complications, and he had recently undergone an operative intervention that had been arranged in advance rather than on short notice, arriving in the ICU in the immediate postoperative period. His Glasgow Coma Score was calculated at 4. His family reported that he had been progressively more tired and confused over the previous day, culminating in an acute decline prompting emergency transport. Vital sign measurements at presentation showed a high body temperature of 39.2 °C, correlating with his flushed skin and possible infectious or inflammatory process. His pulse was recorded at about 89 beats per minute, relatively stable but concerning in the context of the other findings, and his respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute, reflecting an increased workload of breathing. Measurement of arterial pressures yielded a systolic reading of 128 mm Hg and diastolic of 71 mm Hg. Though these blood pressure indices did not indicate frank shock, they demanded close monitoring given his precarious clinical state. Blood tests drawn immediately revealed a serum sodium of 147 mEq/L and potassium of 4.8 mEq/L, suggesting that some electrolytes were at the higher end of normal ranges and warranting repeated checks to detect any further derangements. Of greater concern was the markedly elevated creatinine level measured at 2.6 mg/dL; this indicated a deterioration of renal function in the absence of any documented longstanding kidney disease. His hematocrit was reduced to 29 %, potentially reflecting either chronic anemia or an acute drop that might impair oxygen-carrying capacity and limit the body’s physiologic reserves. Further laboratory data showed that his total white blood cell population was around 10,400 cells/mm³, a mild elevation that could signal an infectious process or another inflammatory trigger. His arterial blood sample exhibited a pH of 7.46, suggesting a mild shift toward alkalinity or a compensated state that could change quickly depending on ongoing metabolic or respiratory stresses. On arrival, he was placed on a markedly increased FiO2 at 80 %, well above half of the inhaled air, to maintain adequate oxygenation. Despite this high supplemental oxygen, his calculated alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient was markedly elevated at about 220 mm Hg, indicating a significant impairment in gas exchange. Clinically, he appeared tachypneic and demonstrated labored inhalations, with accessory muscle recruitment evident on inspection. He had no documented history of chronically reduced kidney function, and conversations with relatives indicated that he had not faced kidney-related admissions in the past, suggesting a new onset for his current renal issue. Given his severe mental status changes, the team worried about the risk of airway compromise or inability to guard the airway should his neurologic function worsen. At the same time, care had to be taken to evaluate potential causes of his elevated temperature, which ranged beyond typical low-grade readings. Because of the level of sedation required to keep him comfortable and safe for further investigations, the team recognized the urgency in ruling out primary infections and other acute problems, particularly in light of his inherent predisposition to complications from infectious agents or organ insults. Plans were considered for imaging studies to identify possible sources of infection, bleeding, or other triggers for abrupt decompensation, while also evaluating for potential complications related to his recent surgery rather than planning any new operative procedure at that time. By the time he underwent initial laboratory and clinical evaluations, he remained in a state of severely impaired consciousness, and his breathing dynamics signaled the possibility of impending respiratory compromise if interventions were delayed. The clinical picture suggested a complex interplay of high fever, acute renal derangement, and disordered mentation, all superimposed on a background of increased susceptibility to severe illness. Ongoing discussions among the critical care team centered on stabilizing him hemodynamically, preventing further organ dysfunction, and determining whether additional operative management would be necessary after his recent elective procedure or whether more extensive stabilization measures needed to precede any further intervention. His condition at the bedside underscored the delicate balance of supporting his circulation, protecting against the risk of worsening kidney injury, and identifying any treatable source of fever. Despite the absence of a known chronic kidney process, the elevated creatinine on arrival emphasized the need for meticulous oversight, including repeated checks of his urine output and the potential for renal imaging if indicated. Throughout this initial assessment, it was evident that further deterioration in vital parameters could precipitate significant danger for a patient with such weakened baseline defenses, reinforcing the necessity of prompt diagnostics and possible interventions.

	APACHE II scoring method explained
	The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) is one of the ICU scoring systems that classify disease outcome in hospitalized patients.
	The above calculator consists of two different versions of the APACHE II model to answer to specialist preferences.
	The first tab from the APACHE II score calculator requires the direct input of clinical data whilst the second tab allows the selection of the intervals in which the patient belongs. The second tab has the advantage of showing the number of points each interval is awarded.
	The variables used in both calculation methods are:
	■ Chronic health conditions and/ or severe organ system insufficiency or is immunocompromised and the following conditions:
	1) Cirrhosis of the liver – biopsy confirmed or portal hypertension or previous history of hepatic failure/encephalopathy/coma.
	2) New York Heart Association Class IV cardiovascular disease.
	3) Severe COPD -- Hypercapnia, home O
	use, or pulmonary hypertension, documented chronic hypoxia or respiratory dependency.
	4) Renal dialysis.
	5) Immunocompromised – through immunosuppression therapy, chemotherapy, radiation, long term steroid medication or autoimmune disease such as lymphoma, AIDS.
	■ Age – as mortality risk factor in many comorbidities;
	■ Temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius – body temperature as indicator of infection and general health;
