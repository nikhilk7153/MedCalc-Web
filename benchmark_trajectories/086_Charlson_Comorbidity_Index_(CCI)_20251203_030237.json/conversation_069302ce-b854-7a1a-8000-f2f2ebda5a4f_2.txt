 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 10 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state. You can see this in your agent history when this happens.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions 
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step. 
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g. 
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
Be clear and concise in your decision-making. Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress. 
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.
</reasoning_rules>

PATIENT NOTE:
A 40-year-old man was referred to gastrointestinal surgeons for pancreatic mass pointed out by an abdominal ultrasonography in a medical check-up. The patient did not show any symptoms. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed dissection from the CA (), DPA, and splenic artery (SA). This aneurysm was not seen on an abdominal unenhanced CT taken 6 years ago in a medical check-up. The enhancing inner lumen of the DPA was derived from false lumen and that of the SA was derived from true lumen. The stenosis of proximal side of SA, an aneurysm measuring 2.5 cm on DPAA with unenhanced mural thrombus, and the connection of the distal side of the DPAA to transverse pancreatic artery (TPA) with stenotic change were confirmed (). A connection with DPA and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was undetermined. The current diagnosis was the dissection of the CA to DPA and SA, resulting in DPAA and SA stenosis. After the diagnosis was made, the patient was referred to the department of radiology by a vascular surgeon for the consultation of endovascular surgery to prevent aneurysm rupture because open surgery was thought to be quite invasive as it required distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and CA repair. He had received medications for hypertension. There were no remarkable findings in his initial laboratory data. We planned to embolize DPAA, SA, and dissected area of CA that allow to preserve vascular supply to hepatic artery from SMA via peripancreatic arcade and to distal side of SA via gastroduodenal artery (GDA) to TPA. An angiography from the CA revealed the enhancing inner lumen of DPAA from false lumen of dissected CA connecting to TPA (). TPA was revealed between the peripancreatic arcade from GDA and pancreatic tail artery that connected to the distal side of SA. A 4.5 Fr. Shepherd hook–type guiding sheath (Parent Plus 45: Medikit, Tokyo, Japan), carrying a triple coaxial system, consisted of a 4 Fr. intermediate catheter (Cerulean G: Medikit, Tokyo, Japan), 2.6 Fr. high-flow catheter (Masters HF: Asahi Intech, Aichi, Japan), 1.9 Fr. microcatheter (Carnelian Marvel: Tokai Medical Products, Aichi, Japan), was hooked on the CA. To prevent the coil migration into the TPA, a microballoon catheter (Logos: Piolax, Yokohama, Japan) was advanced to the distal side of the DPAA via the GDA to pancreatoduodenal artery and inflated at the sufficient point of the TPA through the additional 4 Fr. shepherd hook catheter placed in the CA from the contralateral groin site (). The 4.5 Fr guiding sheath and the 4 Fr. Shepherd hook catheter were inserted from the right and left side of the common femoral artery, respectively. Under microballoon catheter inflation, the distal side of the DPAA was embolized with detachable coils (PRESIDIO 6 mm × 20 cm, GALAXY 6 mm × 15 cm) through a 1.9 Fr microcatheter (). Afterward, the microballoon catheter was deflated. Then, intra-aneurysmal coil embolization was performed with detachable coils (Interlock-35 10 mm × 40 cm, 2 of 8 mm × 40 cm, 6 mm × 20 cm) through the 4 Fr. intermediate catheter (). Later, the microcatheter in the intermediate catheter was carefully advanced through the dissected portion of the SA and embolization of the affected area was performed with detachable coils (Penumbra POD 6 mm × 50 cm, Penumbra 6 mm × 15 cm, 4 mm × 8 cm, GALAXY 2 of 7 mm × 21 cm, 2 of 4 mm × 15 cm) (). Finally, coil embolization of the dissected CA was performed using detachable coils (Interlock-35 10 mm × 40 cm, 2 of 8 mm × 40 cm, 6 mm × 10 cm, 4 mm × 10 cm, 6 mm × 10 cm, Penumbra coil 400 2 of 10 mm × 30 cm) (). The final angiography from SMA after pulling out all the systems revealed complete occlusion of the DPAA, the proximal side of SA, preserving GDA to the TPA to the distal side of SA and preserving GDA to common hepatic artery to left gastric artery (). No complication including post-coiling ischemia or transient laboratory abnormalities in transaminases, amylases, or lipase was observed during and after the endovascular surgery. The patient was followed up for 2 years at the near hospital; however, DPAA has not shown regrowth by contrast enhancement CT.

	Charlson comorbidity index explained
	The CCI is a survival stratification tool that assesses the comorbidity risk associated with several conditions.
	It allows medical specialists to make informed decisions in regard to procedures that patients may or not benefit from.
	The CCI basically predicts the ten-year survival, therefore informing the medical specialist about how the comorbidities the patient is suffering from impact their life expectancy, thus helping them decide upon the short and long term benefits of the treatment they are about to recommend.
	Comorbidities of patients are defined using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes.
	Comorbidity is defined as the presence of one or more additional conditions existing simultaneously, independently or not (with or without a causal effect) with a disease that is considered primary.
	In the CCI the patient’s age is allocated to one of the age groups, each considered to be of a different risk.
	The following table introduces the conditions used in the comorbidity index and the number of points they are awarded:
	Charlson index item
	Points
	Other notes
