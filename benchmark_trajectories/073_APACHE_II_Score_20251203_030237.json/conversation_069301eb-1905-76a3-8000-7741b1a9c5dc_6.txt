 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 10 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state. You can see this in your agent history when this happens.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions 
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step. 
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g. 
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
Be clear and concise in your decision-making. Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress. 
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.

PATIENT NOTE:
A 72-year-old male with leukemia was brought to the hospital for urgent evaluation after experiencing several days of progressive fatigue, mild shortness of breath, and lower abdominal discomfort. He appeared mildly flushed on arrival, with a body temperature of 37.5°C and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Due to the concerning nature of his presentation, he was rapidly admitted to the intensive care unit and underwent prompt assessment. His initial blood pressure measurements showed systolic readings at 120 mm Hg and diastolic readings around 64 mm Hg. Further examination revealed that his heartbeat was regular, averaging approximately 88 beats per minute. He denied any recent episodes of confusion or altered sensorium, and his neurological evaluation was consistent with a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 that reflected full alertness. His arterial blood gas analysis indicated a pH of 7.42, suggesting no major acid-base disturbance at this time, although there remained a heightened concern for potential clinical changes given his risk profile. The fraction of inspired oxygen he required on admission was around 45%, and his measured partial pressure of oxygen was approximately 72 mm Hg, reported in the context of his ongoing respiratory complaints. Laboratory studies performed shortly after arrival showed a sodium concentration of 136 mEq/L and a potassium concentration of 4.3 mEq/L, which were within acceptable limits. However, his serum creatinine level was elevated at 1.8 mg/dL, necessitating careful monitoring of his renal function. Despite this elevated level, there was no immediate concern for acute kidney injury on top of this finding, and he did not manifest signs of significant fluid overload or severe acid-base derangements. His hematocrit was measured at 34%, which was slightly reduced but not acutely critical, and his white blood cell count reached around 12,800 per cubic millimeter, raising the possibility of an infectious or inflammatory process given his background and presenting symptoms. He maintained full orientation according to clinical observation, with preserved verbal and motor responses consistent with a normal level of alertness. Owing to the acuity of his presentation, he underwent an emergent exploratory procedure for a suspected intra-abdominal source of infection or complication, and he was closely observed in the postoperative and critical care setting because of his predisposition to severe infections. Prior medical history included issues that compromise his overall immune defense, so heightened surveillance and aggressive prophylactic measures were implemented. Throughout the initial hours after intervention, he received supportive care while monitoring his respiratory parameters and hemodynamic stability. Additional imaging was obtained to clarify the etiology of his symptoms, and cultures were taken to identify any possible pathogens. Discussion among the care team emphasized vigilance for potential complications, including careful fluid balance and reassessment of his renal parameters. As the hours progressed, he remained hemodynamically stable with no new signs of deteriorating consciousness, and his temperature remained near baseline without further fever spikes. Plans for ongoing management included tailored antimicrobial therapy once specific organisms were identified, potential adjustment of his oxygen requirements if his lung function changed, and continued evaluation of his creatinine level to ensure there was no worsening of renal status. Throughout his stay, detailed monitoring of his laboratory values and clinical status was prioritized, given his significant risk factors and the emergent nature of his presentation.

QUESTION:
What is the patient's APACHE II score?

CRITICAL RULES:
DO NOT calculate or compute the answer yourself, you MUST use the web calculator to get the answer.
Your answer will be marked as incorrect if you do this otherwise.

TASK:
1. Navigate to https://www.mdapp.co/apache-ii-score-calculator-158/
2. Read the patient note and extract the relevant clinical values
3. Fill out the ENTIRE calculator form with the values from the note
4. Click the Calculate button on the webpage
5. Wait for the result to appear on the page
6. Extract ONLY the numerical result that the CALCULATOR computed (not your own calculation)

IMPORTANT - Final Response Format:
After the calculator displays its result, return ONLY this JSON:
{"answer": <number_from_calculator>}

Examples:
- {"answer": 83.94}
- {"answer": 12}
- {"answer": 2.5}

The answer MUST be the value the web calculator computed, NOT a value you calculated yourself.

	APACHE II Score = 12
	Interpretation:
	This score is indicative of a
	mortality risk of 15% in non surgery cases and 7% in post surgery cases

	APACHE II scoring method explained
	The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) is one of the ICU scoring systems that classify disease outcome in hospitalized patients.
	The above calculator consists of two different versions of the APACHE II model to answer to specialist preferences.
	The first tab from the APACHE II score calculator requires the direct input of clinical data whilst the second tab allows the selection of the intervals in which the patient belongs. The second tab has the advantage of showing the number of points each interval is awarded.
	The variables used in both calculation methods are:
	■ Chronic health conditions and/ or severe organ system insufficiency or is immunocompromised and the following conditions:
	1) Cirrhosis of the liver – biopsy confirmed or portal hypertension or previous history of hepatic failure/encephalopathy/coma.
	2) New York Heart Association Class IV cardiovascular disease.
	3) Severe COPD -- Hypercapnia, home O
	use, or pulmonary hypertension, documented chronic hypoxia or respiratory dependency.
	4) Renal dialysis.
	5) Immunocompromised – through immunosuppression therapy, chemotherapy, radiation, long term steroid medication or autoimmune disease such as lymphoma, AIDS.
	■ Age – as mortality risk factor in many comorbidities;
	■ Temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius – body temperature as indicator of infection and general health;
	■ pH – is factored in as sign of pulmonary, metabolic acidosis and several other conditions;
	■ Mean arterial pressure - measured in mmHg, offers information on blood circulation and possible dysfunctions;
	■ Heart rate in beats per minute – the predictive value of resting heart rate;
	■ Respiratory rate in breaths per minute – respiration rhythm provides information on the respiratory system;
	■ Sodium in mEq/L and Potassium in mEq/L – are determined in order to check the serum balance between Na and K;
	■ Acute renal failure (ARF) – is used as risk factor for adverse outcome in critically ill patients with aggravated renal condition;
	■ Creatinine in mg/dL – provides information about renal function, glomerular filtration rate and muscular activity;
	■ Hematocrit % - evaluates the proportion of red blood cells in the blood sample;
	■ White blood cell count in x10
	/µL – factors in a possible infectious state;
	■ A - a gradient if FiO2 ≥0.5 or PaO2 if FiO2 <0.5 – offers information on respiratory function;
	■ Glasgow coma scale points – the score obtained here is subtracted from the maximum score (15).
	The main limitation of the model is the fact that it can only be used in adults, as it has not been validated in pediatric populations.
	The table below introduces the variables used and the number of points awarded to each of their intervals.
	Chronic organ insufficiency
	Mean arterial pressure in mmHg
	Heart rate in beats per minute

APACHE II score result
</query>
<result>
Score range and timing
- APACHE II score range: 0–71.
- Calculated by a medical professional within 24 hours of ICU admission.
- Only validated for adults (not pediatric).

Interpretation summary
- Higher score = greater severity and higher hospital mortality risk.
- Direct relationship between increases in score and increases in mortality risk for surgical and non-surgical patients.

Mortality risk by APACHE II score (non-operative and post-operative)
- 0–4: non-op 4% | post-op 1%
- 5–9: non-op 8% | post-op 3%
- 10–14: non-op 15% | post-op 7%
- 15–19: non-op 24% | post-op 12%
- 20–24: non-op 40% | post-op 30%
- 25–29: non-op 55% | post-op 35%
- 30–34: non-op 73% | post-op 73%
- ≥35: non-op 85% | post-op 88%

Score composition (variables used)
- Number of variables: 14
- Variables: chronic health conditions/severe organ insufficiency or immunocompromise, age, temperature, pH, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, sodium, potassium, acute renal failure status, creatinine, hematocrit, white blood cell count, A–a gradient (if FiO2 ≥0.5) or PaO2 (if FiO2 <0.5), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). 

Other relevant notes from page
- APACHE II was developed by Knaus et al. (1985) from 5,815 patients; validated cohort AUC > 0.8.
- The GCS contribution is applied as points (GCS subtracted from 15) per the scoring tables on the page.

If you need the exact point-awarding intervals for each variable (temperature, pH, MAP, HR, RR, Na, K, creatinine with ARF adjustment, hematocrit, WBC, A–a/PaO2, age, chronic health), request "variable point table" and the page will be extracted.
