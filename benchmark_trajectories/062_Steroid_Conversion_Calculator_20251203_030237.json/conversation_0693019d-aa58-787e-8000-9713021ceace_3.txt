 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 10 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state. You can see this in your agent history when this happens.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions 
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step. 
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g. 
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
Be clear and concise in your decision-making. Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress. 
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.
</reasoning_rules>

No previous web actions performed; ready to start navigation to the target calculator page. Verdict: Success (initialized).
User wants steroid conversion using the MDApp steroid conversion calculator. Patient dose: 45.802 mg PredniSONE PO (from the note). Must use the web calculator and extract only the numeric result it returns.
Open the MDApp steroid conversion calculator page so I can fill the form with the patient's prednisone dose and get the hydrocortisone IV equivalent.
Result
Opened new tab with URL https://www.mdapp.co/steroid-conversion-calculator-282/
<step>
The MDApp calculator page is open and visible in the screenshot but the browser_state shows no interactive elements; need to extract page content to find form element indexes—status: uncertain.
Tab 0B28 is open to the MDApp steroid conversion calculator page; patient's prednisone PO dose = 45.802 mg (from note). The page UI and calculator form are visible in the screenshot but interactive indexes are not yet available.
Extract the page contents to discover the interactive form element indexes so I can fill 'Steroid to convert from' = Prednisone, 'Dosage to convert' = 45.802 mg, 'Steroid to convert to' = Hydrocortisone, then click Calculate.
Result
Query: Locate the steroid conversion calculator form inputs, dropdowns and the Calculate button on the page; return the page HTML or descriptions of interactive elements required to set 'Steroid to convert from', 'Dosage to convert' (units mg), 'Steroid to convert to', and the Calculate button so the form can be filled and submitted.

	Steroid conversion
	The steroid convertor transforms one steroid dosage into another dosage based on the equivalent dose for either IV or oral administration.
	The following table offers information on the equivalent dose, the anti-inflammatory and mineralocorticoid potency and about biological half-life.

	When dosing, you also need to consider the potency and the duration of the effect not only the steroid conversion in mg. For example, drugs such as Dexamethasone have a very long half life, therefore do not require frequent dosing.
	*Biological half life accurately reflects the action duration of corticosteroid medication. The following legend has been used in the table:
	■ Short = 8 – 12 hours;
	■ Intermediate = 12 – 36 hours;
	■ Long = 36 – 72 hours.
	Cortisone – also known as corticosteroid, suppresses inflammation in conditions such as arthritis, lupus, ulcerative colitis etc.
	Hydrocortisone – is a topical corticosteroid that reduces redness and itching in skin conditions.
	Prednisone – is an anti-inflammatory that suppresses the immune system, it is used to treat allergic disorders, skin conditions, arthritis etc.
	Prednisolone – is the active metabolite of prednisone, it is used as a prednisone replacement in the above specified conditions, in patients with liver failure.
	Triamcinolone – relieves inflammation in various skin conditions.
	Methylprednisolone – used in conditions that respond to corticosteroids like the ones above but also in conditions affecting the nervous system, blood cells and lungs.
	Betamethasone – used to treat rheumatic disorders, dermatitis, asthma, Crohn disease, and in adrenocortical insufficiency.
	Dexamethasone – is used as inflammatory but also along antibiotics in tuberculosis treatment.
	Steroid dosage forms
	The following table introduces the most common steroid dosage forms, either oral tablets, injection or oral solution:

<query>
Locate the steroid conversion calculator form inputs, dropdowns and the Calculate button on the page; return the page HTML or descriptions of interactive elements required to set 'Steroid to convert from', 'Dosage to convert' (units mg), 'Steroid to convert to', and the Calculate button so the form can be filled and submitted.
</query>
<result>
Steroid conversion form elements present on the page (as extracted from the page markdown):

1) "Steroid to convert from" — dropdown (select)
- Visible label text: Steroid to convert from
- Visible select options (in-page text): 
  - Select
  - Cortisone
  - Hydrocortisone
  - Prednisone
  - Prednisolone
  - Triamcinolone
  - Methylprednisolone
  - Betamethasone
  - Dexamethasone

2) "Dosage to convert" — numeric dosage input (units mg)
- Visible label text: Dosage to convert
- Units shown in the page header: units mg (user request asked for units mg; page states conversions are in mg and the steroid equivalence table lists mg doses)
- The page markdown does not include explicit HTML for an input element (name/id/type) for the dosage; only the label "Dosage to convert" appears. No input attributes (id, name, type) or placeholder value are present in the provided content.

3) "Steroid to convert to" — dropdown (select)
- Visible label text: Steroid to convert to
- Visible select options (in-page text): 
  - Select
  - Cortisone
  - Hydrocortisone
  - Prednisone
  - Prednisolone
  - Triamcinolone
  - Methylprednisolone
  - Betamethasone
  - Dexamethasone

4) Calculate button
- The page markdown does not contain a visible Calculate button element or its HTML (no button text, id, or input[type=submit] present in the provided content).
- Note: the page includes an embedded widget placeholder (<div id="mdapp-widget" app-id="282"></div><script async src="https://tools.mdapp.co/js/sdk.js"></script>) which likely renders the interactive calculator in the live page; the provided markdown does not include the widget-generated HTML (so the Calculate button and concrete input element attributes are not present in this extracted content).

Summary / action items for form automation
- Dropdown option labels to set for "Steroid to convert from" and "Steroid to convert to": Cortisone, Hydrocortisone, Prednisone, Prednisolone, Triamcinolone, Methylprednisolone, Betamethasone, Dexamethasone (plus a default “Select” option).
- Dosage to convert: numeric value in mg (page implies mg units).
- Calculate button: not present in the provided markdown — likely injected by the embedded widget (mdapp-widget). To programmatically set and submit the form you will need the rendered HTML produced by the embedded widget (use the live page DOM or provide further content using start_from_char to capture widget-rendered HTML).
