 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 10 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state. You can see this in your agent history when this happens.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions 
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step. 
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g. 
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
Be clear and concise in your decision-making. Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress. 
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.

PATIENT NOTE:
A 73-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of severe back pain and right leg pain for 1 month. The medical history of patient revealed that he was diagnosed as a hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier about 20 years earlier, but was lost to follow up. The patient was not a heavy drinker or smoker. There was no significant family history. On physical examination, a palpable and hard mass was noted in the right pelvic area. Hepatomegaly, liver masses, and ascites were absent. Initial laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 4,830/µL, hemoglobin 15.2 g/dL, platelets 138,000/µL, total protein 7.8 g/dL, albumin 4.4 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 31 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 35 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL, alkaline phosphate 98 IU/L, prothrombin time 14 second (INR 1.21), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 15.01 ng/mL, and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) 864 mAU/mL. Hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) were positive. Hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), HBV-DNA with polymerase chain reaction, and serological markers of hepatitis C were negative. He belonged to Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A.
For evaluation of the pelvic mass, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed. They demonstrated a 13×10 cm expansile mass that involved the right iliac bone (). The patient underwent an incisional biopsy with the impression of a malignant bone tumor. However, on pathological examination, the tumor was composed of polygonal cells with ample cytoplasm and trabecular pattern. In immunohistochemical stains, these tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), hepatocyte paraffin 1 (HepPar1), and glypican-3, which confirmed the diagnosis of HCC (). Tumor cells were negative for CD56, chromogranin A and synaptophysin, which are the markers of neuroendocrine differentiation. To find the primary focus, abdominal CT, MRI, positron emission tomography (PET) scans and angiography were performed. However, no tumor was found in the liver in these radiologic examinations.
We diagnosed this case as an isolated metastatic HCC of the pelvic bone without the presence of a primary cancer in the liver. Surgical resection of the tumor was recommended, but the patient refused an operation because of old age and the large size of the tumor. Instead, we decided to treat him with combined modalities. He started radiotherapy in the pelvic area with a total dose of 5,100 cGy in 17 fractions. One week after the end of radiotherapy, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed in the metastatic HCC of the pelvic bone via the right internal iliac artery (adriamycin 50 mg and 20 mL of lipiodol). Then, the patient was treated with five cycles of systemic chemotherapy based on 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU, 1,000 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3) and cisplatin (90 mg/m2 on day 2 every 4 weeks). After the completion of chemotherapy, the tumor became almost necrotic. The AFP and PIVKA-II levels decreased to the normal ranges (2.85 ng/mL and 28 mAU/mL, respectively). As the treatment resulted in near complete regression of the tumor, the patient underwent close follow-up without chemotherapy. However, 12 months after chemotherapy, a CT scan revealed multiple lung metastases in both lungs with increasing AFP and PIVKA-II levels (182 ng/mL and 38 mAU/mL, respectively). He was treated with two cycles of systemic chemotherapy with the same regimen (5-FU 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 2 and 3 and cisplatin 90 mg/m2 on day 2). After two cycles of chemotherapy, the patient refused additional chemotherapy and we provided him with supportive care thereafter. Even though the lung metastases were newly developed, primary HCC had not been detected in the sequential radiological examinations, including abdominal CT and PET CT scans.

QUESTION:
What is the patient's score of the Fibrosis 4 Index? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.

CRITICAL RULES:
DO NOT calculate or compute the answer yourself, you MUST use the web calculator to get the answer.
Your answer will be marked as incorrect if you do this otherwise.

TASK:
1. Navigate to https://www.mdapp.co/fibrosis-4-fib-4-score-calculator-107/
2. Read the patient note and extract the relevant clinical values
3. Fill out the ENTIRE calculator form with the values from the note
4. Click the Calculate button on the webpage
5. Wait for the result to appear on the page
6. Extract ONLY the numerical result that the CALCULATOR computed (not your own calculation)

IMPORTANT - Final Response Format:
After the calculator displays its result, return ONLY this JSON:
{"answer": <number_from_calculator>}

Examples:
- {"answer": 83.94}
- {"answer": 12}
- {"answer": 2.5}

The answer MUST be the value the web calculator computed, NOT a value you calculated yourself.

	FIB 4 formula
	The FIB 4 score evaluates the degree of fibrosis in patients suspected of or already diagnosed with hepatic fibrosis.
	The score contributes to assessment of NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), HCV (hepatic C virus) or cholestatic and metabolic liver diseases.
	There are four variables taken into account:
	■ Patient age is used because there is a direct correlation between age increase and progression of liver fibrosis. This is particularly obvious in patients with hepatitis C and chronic alcohol consumption.
	■ AST is aspartate aminotransferase which is an enzyme found in several types of tissue (liver, kidney, heart, brain). Normal values are between 5 and 40 IU/L and increases usually suggest tissue injury.
	■ ALT is the alanine aminotransferase which is an enzyme specific to hepatic tissue that also shows injury when higher than 7-56 IU/L.
	■ Platelet count is used to identify whether there are sufficient clotting particles (those produced by liver) and thus indirectly test liver function.
	This score employs the following equation:
	FIB 4 = (Age x AST) / (Platelet count x √ALT)
	It can help with regular assessment of fibrosis without the need for carrying a highly invasive procedure with substantial morbidity, such as liver biopsy.
	Score interpretation
	The result provided from the above equation is interpreted according to two cut off values:
	■ FIB 4 <1.45 indicates absence of cirrhosis (with a negative predictive value of 90% for advanced fibrosis);
	■ FIB 4 between 1.45 - 3.25 are deemed inconclusive;
	■ FIB 4 >3.25 indicates cirrhosis (with a positive predictive value of 65% for advanced fibrosis).
	Patients with low score are not required to undergo liver biopsy (as medical management is sufficient) but patients with high scores may be, as to confirm or infirm liver disease diagnosis.
	Where a patient scores high and also has other clinical or imaging signs of progression to end-stage liver disease, biopsy may not be necessary anymore.
	Also, patient with liver cirrhosis often need to undergo screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and gastroesophageal varices.
	About the study
	This non-invasive fibrosis score was created by
	[1237]<a />
		Sterling
	et al. in 2006 and was aimed at patients with HIV/hepatitis C virus coinfection.
	A retrospective analysis was performed in 832 patients (design and validation set) and the liver fibrosis was evaluated via Ishak score. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed the four parameters most significantly associated with fibrosis.

You failed 3 times. Therefore we terminate the agent.
Your only tool available is the "done" tool. No other tool is available. All other tools which you see in history or examples are not available.
If the task is not yet fully finished as requested by the user, set success in "done" to false! E.g. if not all steps are fully completed. Else success to true.
Include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text.

  "evaluation_previous_goal": "Successfully opened the MDApp FIB-4 calculator page and located the input fields (age, AST, ALT, platelet count). Verdict: Success.",
  "memory": "I navigated to https://www.mdapp.co/fibrosis-4-fib-4-score-calculator-107/ and confirmed the calculator form fields are present: Patient age, AST (IU/L), ALT (IU/L), Platelet Count (10^9/L), plus Calculate/Reset buttons. I extracted the patient's baseline admission labs from the provided clinical note: age 73 years, AST 31 IU/L, ALT 35 IU/L, platelet count 138,000/µL (i.e., 138 x10^9/L). No calculation was performed because the agent was terminated and the only available tool is done.",
  "next_goal": "The next immediate goal would have been to fill the calculator form with Age=73, AST=31, ALT=35, Platelet Count=138 (10^9/L), click Calculate, wait for the result, and extract only the numerical result produced by the web calculator.",

        "text": "Task status: NOT COMPLETED (agent terminated before running the calculator).\n\nWhat I completed:\n- Opened the target calculator page: https://www.mdapp.co/fibrosis-4-fib-4-score-calculator-107/\n- Verified the form input fields are present on the page: Patient age, AST (IU/L), ALT (IU/L), Platelet Count (10^9/L), and the Calculate button.\n- Extracted the relevant baseline values from the patient note (admission values, prior to any treatment):\n  - Age: 73 years\n  - AST: 31 IU/L\n  - ALT: 35 IU/L\n  - Platelet count: 138,000/µL (reporting unit on the calculator: 10^9/L → enter as 138)\n\nWhat I did NOT do (and therefore the final required output is not produced):\n- I did NOT fill the online form and click Calculate (the agent was terminated and only the done tool was available). Per the user's CRITICAL RULES, the FIB-4 score must be obtained from the web calculator and not computed locally; because the web interaction to submit the form and read the calculator output was not completed, I cannot provide the calculator result.\n\nRecommendation to finish the task (what should be done next):\n1. Open https://www.mdapp.co/fibrosis-4-fib-4-score-calculator-107/\n2. Enter the following values into the form fields:\n   - Patient age: 73\n   - AST (IU/L): 31\n   - ALT (IU/L): 35\n   - Platelet Count (10^9/L): 138\n3. Click the \"Calculate\" button and wait for the page to display the computed FIB-4 score.\n4. Extract only the numerical value shown by the calculator and return it in the required JSON format, e.g. {\"answer\": <number_from_calculator>}.\n\nBecause the web calculator step (form submission and extraction of the calculator-produced numeric result) was not performed, I must set success=false.",
