6,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-5526772-1,Extracted,"A 41-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital with liver damage, itchy skin, and pyrexia. His medical history was unremarkable, but one year previously his gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels had risen to 271 IU/L (normal: < 30 IU/L). Prior to this, the patient had consumed 540 mL of sake three times a week, and he had been reducing the amount of alcohol he consumed for about one year. He did not smoke or take any recreational drugs. He was single, was not homosexual, and he had not had sexual intercourse for over one year.
The patient had undergone treatment of his internal hemorrhoids as an outpatient at a nearby hospital that comprised an aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) injection. He developed a fever of 38 °C, dark colored urine, and itchy skin on postoperative day (POD) 1, and he took loxoprofen sodium, as required. He consulted another doctor on POD 7, because the symptoms had not improved, and his blood test results led to a diagnosis of liver dysfunction. His liver dysfunction had not improved by POD 14, and he was admitted to our hospital on POD 15.
The patient was 167 cm tall and weighed 52.5 kg. He presented with a blood pressure of 103/59 mmHg, a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, a temperature of 36.6 °C, and 99% oxygen saturation in room air. No specific physical findings were evident during the clinical examination on the day of hospitalization, but the patient had a rash, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and jaundice. The subjective symptoms, comprising the fever, dark colored urine, and itchy skin, had disappeared by POD 10.
The laboratory test results showed that the patient’s complete blood count was almost normal with a white blood cell count of 6900 cells/μL, a hemoglobin concentration of 14.7 g/dL, a hematocrit level of 43.1%, and a platelet count of 3.98 × 105 cells/μL, but a higher percentage of eosinophils was present (6.8%) (normal: 1.0%-5.0%), which peaked at 13.9% on POD 20. The patient’s serum liver enzyme and bilirubin levels were elevated at the time of admission. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 432 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was 911 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was 473 IU/L (normal: 115-359 IU/L), and the total bilirubin level was 1.3 mg/dL (normal: 0.2-1.2 mg/dL). Thus, compared with the ALP level, the AST and ALT levels showed greater magnitudes of elevation. The patient’s other blood test results were within the normal ranges, as follows: serum albumin: 4.0 g/dL (normal: 3.8-5.2 g/dL); serum creatinine: 0.86 mg/dL (normal: 0.65-1.09 mg/dL); C-reactive protein: 0.1 mg/dL (normal: 0-0.3 mg/dL); prothrombin time: 100% (normal: 80%-120 %); thyroid-stimulating hormone: 0.5 μIU/mL (normal: 0.34-4.04 μIU/mL); triiodothyronine: 2.98 pg/dL (normal: 2.36-5.00 pg/dL); and thyroxin: 1.18 ng/dL (normal: 0.88-1.67 ng/dL). The serological tests for autoantibodies generated weakly positive results (1:40) for anti-nuclear antibodies, and negative results for anti-smooth muscle and anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Negative results were obtained from the tests for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen, the hepatitis C virus antibody, rapid plasma reagin, the anti-Epstein-Barr virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, and the anti-cytomegalovirus IgM antibody, and from the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test. The IgG level was within the normal range at 1415 mg/dL (normal: 800-1600 mg/dL) and the IgM level was within the normal range at 100 mg/dL (normal: 60-250 mg/dL). The IgE level was elevated at 1333 mg/dL (normal: < 250 mg/dL). Chest radiography did not reveal any abnormalities. No morphological changes were evident following abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and abdominal computed tomography (Figure ).
When the patient was hospitalized, we considered viral, alcohol-induced, autoimmune, drug-induced, biliary tract, and thyroid function-based diseases as frequent causes of acute liver dysfunction for the differential diagnosis, and, based on the patient’s medical history, and the serological and imaging results, we considered that alcohol and DILI were highly likely causes of the patient’s acute liver dysfunction. However, the patient had stopped drinking during the past year, so we thought that there was a high likelihood of DILI. Therefore, we began conservative treatment with a small amount of extracellular fluid replacement.
Figure presents the patient’s symptoms, laboratory test results, and treatment over the entire course. The liver transaminase and bilirubin levels decreased rapidly after admission, and the maximum levels were as follows: ALT: 950 IU/L on POD 15; AST: 470 IU/L on POD 17; and total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL on POD 17. The ALP and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels showed consistent downward trends from POD 7. The patient's symptoms disappeared on POD 10, and no new symptoms appeared after hospitalization. We performed a liver biopsy on POD 25, and a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) of the components of the ALTA injection and lidocaine on POD 28. The patient was discharged on POD 29, and he was managed as an outpatient without any prescriptions. At the time of the patient’s first outpatient appointment on POD 35, his liver transaminase and bilirubin levels had declined and were almost within the normal ranges.
Figure presents hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)-stained sections of the liver biopsy performed on POD 25. The H and E staining showed that the basic structure of the liver had been maintained without any hepatocyte dropout or disruption, and that the bile duct had not been disrupted. At a higher magnification, the H and E staining showed that the parenchymal cells were partially dilated and that a mild inflammatory cell infiltration was present in the area of the central vein. Neither eosinophil nor plasma cell infiltrations were detected within the liver tissue. Bile plugs were found at multiple sites within the parenchyma and sinusoids. Masson staining did not show the presence of liver tissue fibrosis.
The lymphocyte proliferation activity levels, which were determined from the DLST performed on POD 28, were 676 counts per minute (cpm) for the control and 871 cpm for the ALTA with lidocaine. The stimulation index, which was calculated as the ALTA with lidocaine cpm divided by the control cpm, was 1.29 (normal in Japanese people: < 1.8).","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight. You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [52.5, 'kg'], 'height': [167.0, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [0.86, 'mg/dL'], 'age': [41, 'years']}",83.93895,79.742,88.1359,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 41 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 0.86 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 167.0 cm, which is 167.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.67 m. The patient's weight is 52.5 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 52.5 kg / (1.67 m * 1.67 m) = 18.82463 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 18.8, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 52.5 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 41) * 52.5 * 1) / (0.86 * 72) = 83.93895 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 83.93895 mL/min."
19,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-4641361-1,Extracted,"In November 2007, a 49-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital from an orthopaedist complaining of a one year history of sustained difficulty walking and severe bilateral hip pain. Her height was 155.5 cm and body weight was 61.0 kg. Laboratory data showed a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl, potassium 2.8 mmol/l, calcium 9.5 mg/dl, phosphorus 2.5 mg/dl, uric acid 1.5 mg/dl, normoglycaemic glycosuria and metabolic acidemia (pH 7.30, HCO3− 17.4 mmol/l) (Table ). Bilateral transcervical fractures were confirmed by MRI (Fig. ) and bone scintigraphy showed multiple hot spots in her joints and ribs, compatible with osteomalacia (Fig. ). Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was diagnosed clinically from a low serum level of phosphorus, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (11.0 pg/dl), high levels of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (67.5 IU/l), and the findings of bone scintigram, although a bone biopsy was not performed. Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) was ruled out by total body survey with whole body computed tomography or endoscopic surveillances and a normal blood FGF23 (22.1 pg/ml, 10–50 pg/ml) level.
Urinalysis showed pH 6.0 and twenty four hour urine demonstrated a low renal fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphate (Tmp/GFR 0.91), increased fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA 43.9 %) and generalized aminoaciduria.
The calculated anion gap was 12.4 meq/l, with an inappropriately alkaline urine (pH 6.0), suggestive of distal type of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). An intravenous bicarbonate loading test to assess the tubular dysfunction demonstrated that the increased fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FEHCO3− 13.25 %) and urine-blood (UB) Pco2 gradient (U-Bpco2 50.1 mmHg), suggesting the presence of proximal type of RTA. NH4Cl loading test was not performed because of the presence of apparent metabolic acidemia. These biochemical data of blood and urine indicated Fanconi syndrome with proximal type of RTA. Tests for anti-SSA and anti-SSB were negative and serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels were normal. Furthermore, serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis revealed no monoclonal component. Any of the patient’s medication did not seem to be related to Fanconi syndrome. Light microscopic examination of a kidney biopsy demonstrated cellular infiltration of interstitium and proximal tubular epithelium composed mainly of CD3+ lymphocytes without glomerular involvement, consistent with features of TIN (Fig. ,).
The patient was also suspected to be diagnosed as PBC because of high levels of alkaline phosphatase (663 IU/l), high serum IgM levels (1084 mg/dl) and the presence of anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody (1:10). Sequential liver biopsy demonstrated the presence of a periportal cellular infiltrate (Fig. ), compatible with PBC though biochemical liver function was normal. The combination of these findings led to the patient’s diagnosis of osteomalacia caused by TIN with Fanconi syndrome in asymptomatic PBC.
The patient was started on therapy with calcitriol (1 μg/day), neutral potassium phosphate and sodium bicarbonate (6 g/day). She was subsequently administered middle-dose corticosteroid (20 mg/day of predonisolone) and ursodeoxycholic acid (300 mg/day). One year after the treatment, the patient became asymptomatic and renal function remained stable. Furthermore, MRI showed the bilateral transcervical fractures of the femoral neck had almost fully repaired (Fig. ). Treatment is currently being continued in the outpatient clinic.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.
The patient is 49 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 155.5 cm, which is 155.5 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.555 m. The patient's weight is 61.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 61.0 kg / (1.555 m * 1.555 m) = 25.2272 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 25.2, indicating they are overweight/obese.
Because the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight).
For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
For females, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
The patient's gender is Female.
The patient's height is 155.5 cm, which is 155.5 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 61.22051 in. 
Plugging in the values for the IBW formula for females gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (61.22051 (in inches) - 60) = 48.30717 kg.
Hence, the patient's IBW is 48.30717 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight).
To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 48.30717 kg + 0.4 * (61.0 kg  - 48.30717 kg) = 53.3843 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 53.3843 kg.
Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 49) * 53.3843 * 0.85) / (1.4 * 72) = 40.96504 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 40.96504 mL/min."
1,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-7671985-1,Extracted,"An 87-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for anorexia for several days, high-grade fever from the previous day, and liver dysfunction. Of note, he had a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and angina. Physical examination findings included: clear consciousness; height, 163 cm; weight, 48 kg; blood pressure, 66/40 mmHg; heart rate, 75/min; respiratory rate, 22/min; oxygen saturation of peripheral artery, 96%; and body temperature, 38.1 °C. He had no surface lymphadenopathy. Laboratory findings included: white blood cell (WBC) count, 4.2 × 109/L; hemoglobin, 9.6 g/dL; platelet count, 106 × 109/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 1662 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 6562 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 1407 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 509 IU/L; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), 130 IU/L; total bilirubin, 2.7 mg/dL; prothrombin time (PT), 20.3 s; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.73; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 34.4 mg/dL; and creatinine, 1.4 mg/dL. Serologic tests were all negative for hepatitis A, B, C, and E. Computed tomography (CT) performed at admission revealed no distinct nodules or masses in the liver, but mild splenomegaly, multiple hypodense splenic lesions, and para-aortic lymph node swelling (Fig. a–c). Antibiotics were administered intravenously for suspected acute cholangitis and sepsis, but the fever persisted. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 2 days later newly depicted gallbladder wall thickening and ascites (Figs. , ). On the same night, the patient presented with grade II hepatic encephalopathy, with blood tests showing a decrease in platelet count and worsening liver function suggestive of “acute type” ALF with hepatic coma and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). While consideration was being given to treating acute liver failure, the patient suddenly developed ventricular fibrillation and died despite immediate resuscitation measures on day 3 of hospitalization.
Given the rapid clinical course, an autopsy was performed in this patient with suspected ALF likely due to drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis of indeterminate etiology, circulatory disturbance, metabolic disease, or malignant cells including malignant lymphoma. This led to the patient being diagnosed with malignant, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, characterized by multiple lymph-node, as well as multi-organ (i.e., spleen, liver, lung, and prostate) involvement: (1) general swelling of lymph nodes in the para-abdominal aorta (Fig. a), peripancreatic, peribronchial, pulmonary hilar, subclavicular regions, as well as in the pelvis, especially around the iliac arteries, measuring up to 60 mm in diameter; (2) presence of multiple whitish splenic nodules (Fig. b) with the entire spleen shown to be microscopically infiltrated by tumor cells (Fig. a); (3) irregular geographical morphology of the liver (Fig. c) with the lymphoma cells mainly infiltrating the portal areas (Fig. b); (4) involvement of the right lobe of the lung; (5) involvement of both lobes of the prostate consequent to outer connective tissue involvement (Fig. c). Microscopically, the tumor cells in the lymph nodes were shown to have medium-sized irregular nuclei and small nucleoli with a high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, thus showing diffuse proliferation characterized by the presence of large numbers of small T-cells (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry revealed the tumor cells to be positive for CD20 (Fig. a), CD79a (Fig. b), bcl-2 (Fig. c), and MUM1 (Fig. d), but negative for CD3 (Fig. e), CD10, bcl-6, and cyclin D1, with a Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) of 16% (Fig. f).

Her background medical history included hypertension, and type 2 diabetes for which she was on regular sitagliptin-metformin 50/1000 mg half tablet twice a day, metoprolol 25 mg twice daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily and simvastatin 40 mg daily. She had a long medical history of recurrent otitis media for which she required grommet insertion. She was managed as outpatient with topical and oral ciprofloxacin by her otolaryngologist. Trial of oral trimethoprim-sulphamethaxazole (Bactrim DS) was prescribed without much clinical improvement. Eight weeks prior to this admission, she had symptoms of earache, localised post auricular swelling and fever. A CT scan showed mastoiditis and a contiguous subperiosteal abscess. A brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan and Technetium 99 m labelled bone scan which revealed osteomyelitis (OM) of the petrous temporal bone (Figure ). She underwent an emergency cortical mastoidectomy with drainage of the abscess and insertion of a new right ear grommet. Empirical therapy with ticarcillin-clavulanate (12.4 grams/day) was commenced.
A surface swab from the ear isolated Escherichia coli (which was sensitive to ticarcillin-clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime and gentamicin, but resistant to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin). Susceptibilities were done using Vitek2 (Biomerieux, Marcy l’Etolie, France) using standard Gram negative card. Based on the antibiogram the isolate most likely had underlying extended spectrum beta lactamase, although confirmatory testing was not done as per current testing policy (non-sterile site isolate). The operative specimens of pus and tissue taken at the time of surgery remained sterile. Her antibiotic was changed to cefepime (6 grams/day).

The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.
The patient is 62 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 85.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of creatinine is 85.0 µmol. To convert 85.0 µmol of creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 85.0 µmol creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 8.5e-05 mol creatinine. To convert from mol creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 8.5e-05 mol creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.00962 g creatinine. To convert 0.00962 g of creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.00962 g creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 9.62 mg creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 9.62 mg creatinine/10.0 dL = 0.962 mg creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 85.0 µmol creatinine/L converts to 0.962 mg creatinine/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 1.6 m. The patient's weight is 72.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 72.0 kg / (1.6 m * 1.6 m) = 28.125 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 28.1, indicating they are overweight/obese.
Because the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight).
For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
For females, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
The patient's gender is Female.
The patient's height is 1.6 m, which is 1.6 m * 39.3701 in/m = 62.99216 in. 
Plugging in the values for the IBW formula for females gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (62.99216 (in inches) - 60) = 52.38197 kg.
Hence, the patient's IBW is 52.38197 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight).
To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 52.38197 kg + 0.4 * (72.0 kg  - 52.38197 kg) = 60.22918 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 60.22918 kg.
Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 62) * 60.22918 * 0.85) / (0.962 * 72) = 57.65181 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 57.65181 mL/min."

He had no other arteriosclerotic risks such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, or smoking. He had no past medical history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or peripheral artery disease. The patient’s father and three brothers were also under hemodialysis due to ADPKD. None of the family members had a vascular system complication such as cerebral aneurysm, or past medical history of stroke. A brain CT scan image showed dilatation of left vertebral artery, basilar artery, bilateral post cerebral artery, and middle cerebral artery (Fig. a, b). At the time, he was diagnosed as vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia and started antihypertensive agents. In 2010, he was once admitted to our hospital for dysarthria, dysphagia and right hemiplegia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed acute infarction in the left midbrain, and he was started treatment with anticoagulant and additional antihypertensive agents. Although he recovered from dysarthria and dysphagia, right mild hemiplegia remained. However, he did not have any new stroke events until the admission in 2012.
On admission in 2012, his height was 163.1 cm, weight was 58.5 kg, consciousness level was 13 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, blood pressure was 146/92 mmHg, and body temperature was 36.7 °C. His conjunctiva was anemic, abdomen showed hepatomegaly and bilateral kidney swelling, and lower extremities had bilateral pitting edema. Neurological examination revealed prompt light reflection, isocoric pupil, limitation of the adduction of the right eye when gazing to the left, dysarthria, and bilateral incomplete paralysis.
Laboratory data were as follows: serum Cr 10.7 mg/dL, BUN 48 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 4.4 mL/min/1.73 m2, hemoglobin (Hb) 10.7 g/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) 5700/μL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.4 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 6 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 6 IU/L and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 164 IU/L. Brain MRI showed acute ischemia of bilateral pons and right temporal lobe. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) did not show significant change in vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia compared with MRA in 2010. We started urokinase 60,000 unit/day and argatroban hydrate 60 mg/day. He was once recovered, and continued rehabilitation and maintenance hemodialysis. After 3 months of admission, he suddenly showed impaired consciousness of 6 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, convulsion, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration. CT scan image did not show any cerebral hemorrhage. Exacerbation of cerebral infarction was suspected, and we started argatroban hydrate 60 mg/day, aleviatin, and non-invasive positive pressure (NPPV). Fourteen days after convulsion, he died of sudden fall in blood pressure (Fig. ).
An autopsy was performed, and the brain was pathologically examined. Macroscopically, massive hemorrhage in subarachnoid were seen due to rupture of basilar tip aneurysm (Fig. a, b). Autopsy diagnosis of his death was subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intravascular lumen of the basilar tip aneurysm was nearly obstructed by thrombi (Fig. c). Old cerebral infarctions were seen in the left temporal lobe and other areas. Basilar, left vertebral, bilateral carotid, bilateral middle, and bilateral post cerebral artery showed irregular dilatation of the vessel wall. A microscopic examination of the dilatation area had rupture of the internal elastic lamina and thinning of the media (Fig. d). A wide range of vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia was also confirmed pathologically. In other organs, systemic arteries also showed marked atherosclerosis, and bilateral iliac artery had an aneurysm-like dilatation.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight. You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.","{'sex': 'Male', 'age': [60, 'years'], 'weight': [58.5, 'kg'], 'height': [163.1, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [10.7, 'mg/dL']}",6.07477,5.77103,6.37851,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 60 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 10.7 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 163.1 cm, which is 163.1 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.631 m. The patient's weight is 58.5 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 58.5 kg / (1.631 m * 1.631 m) = 21.99115 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 22.0, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 58.5 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 60) * 58.5 * 1) / (10.7 * 72) = 6.07477 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 6.07477 mL/min."

The patient developed edema of the facial region and two lower limbs 3 mo ago without obvious cause. Her symptoms were mild in the morning and severe in the afternoon. At the same time, she experienced migratory pain of the small joints, which improved after movement, as well as decreased urinary volume, weakness, and poor appetite.
The patient had a free previous medical history.
The patient’s temperature was 36.6 °C, heart rate was 78 bpm, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure was 122/80 mmHg, and oxygen saturation in room air was 98%. The patient was conscious and she complied with the physician's physical examination. Her heart, lungs, and abdomen examinations showed no significant abnormalities, no percussion pain in her kidney area, and severe pitting edema in both lower extremities.
Routine urine examination revealed the following: Proteinuria +++, hematuria ++; phase of urinary red blood cells: Deformed erythrocytosis 70%, urine protein quantitation 4.2 g/24 h; urea nitrogen 15.7 mmol/L, and serum creatinine 141.4 μmol/L. Routine blood test results were as follows: Hemoglobin 92 g/L, white blood cells 4.8 × 109/L, blood platelets 218 × 109/L, antinuclear antibody 1:3200, cytoplasmic granules 1:1000, ds-DNA antibody > 1:3200, C3 0.56 g/L, and C4 0.22 g/L.
Pathological results showed 35 glomeruli in the punctured renal tissue, including one with global sclerosis, two with ischemic sclerosis, and the remaining glomeruli with diffuse proliferation of mesangial cells and endothelial cells, accompanied by segmental dual-track formation of a thickened basement membrane, segmental Meyer's loop, leukocyte infiltration, and segmental microthrombus formation. Fuchsinophilic protein deposition can be found at the mesangial region and subepithelial region, including fibrin crescent formation of one cell. The kidney tubular epithelium exhibited granular and vacuolar degeneration, as well as multifocal atrophy. The renal interstitium showed multishaped lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration, together with mild thickening of the arteriole wall. Paraffin immunofluorescence revealed: Immunoglobulin (Ig) G (++), IgA (++), IgM (++), C3 (+), fall risk assessment (+), C1q (++), and granular deposition along the mesangial region and capillary wall. Combined with clinical findings, this condition was considered diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis, with IV-G (A), AI = 11, and CI = 5. AI was scored as follows: Cellular proliferation (2 points), leukocyte infiltration (1 point), nuclear fragmentation/fibrinoid necrosis (2 points), cell crescent (0 points), Meyer's loop/thrombus (2 points), and interstitial monocyte infiltration (2 points). CI was scored as follows: Sclerosis (2 points), fibrin crescent (0 points), tubular atrophy (2 points), and interstitial fibrosis (2 points) (Figure ).
After consideration of the renal puncture results, oral administration of prednisone was begun at 50 mg/d, and meanwhile, cyclophosphamide was applied through intravenous injection at a dosage of 1.0 g monthly, which lasted for a consecutive 6 mo and was stopped after an accumulative use of 6 g. The serum creatinine fluctuated within an approximate range of 120-160 μmol/L, and blood albumin fluctuated from approximately 29-35 g/L. Then, the patient began to take AZA 50 mg/d as maintenance treatment but experienced extensive alopecia and shedding of pubic hair on the 13th day after oral administration. Pharyngalgia appeared on the 14th day, and fever with a body temperature up to 42 ℃ occurred on the 15th day. The patient came to the hospital for the second time. Physical examination revealed the following: Body temperature, 39.4 ℃; pulse, 92 times/min; breath rate, 22 times/min; blood pressure, 182/100 mmHg. The patient exhibited clear consciousness and emotional distress; she presented scattered chromatosis on her skin, and a rash was found on the inner surface of the bilateral thighs. Pharyngeal congestion was noted, and the breath sounds of the two lungs were clear. The heart rate was 92 times/min. The abdomen was flat, soft, and free from tenderness or rebound tenderness, and there was no liver or spleen involvement. Routine blood work showed the following: Hemoglobin 72 g/L, white blood cell count 1.25 × 109/L, blood platelet count 13 × 109/L, lymphocyte ratio 95.7%, neutrophil ratio 1.6%, and neutrophil count 0.01 × 109/L (Figure ). The results of the bone marrow biopsy were as follows: Myelodysplasia low in the myelogram and focal hyperplasia in bone marrow tissue with active hyperplasia in some areas (Figure ). Routine urinalysis results were as follows: Protein (+), occult blood 2+, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positivity (3.58 × 104). TPMT genotyping testing (four single nucleotide polymorphisms, single base extension method) revealed the following: TPMT 3C gene polymorphism (719A>G) (this site is the most common gene mutation site in Asians) test result: A/A; TPMT 3B gene polymorphism (460G>A) test result: G/G; TPMT 2 gene polymorphism (238G>C) test result: G/G; no abnormity was found in any of the above results.","Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
If the creatinine concentration is less than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL and the patient is female, A = 0.7 and B = -0.241.
If the creatinine concentration is less than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL and the patient is male, A = 0.9 and B = -0.302.
If the creatinine concentration is greater than 0.7 mg/dL and the patient is female, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.
If the creatinine concentration is greater than 0.9 mg/dL and the patient is male, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.
The patient is 22 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.
The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 141.4 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 141.4 µmol. To convert 141.4 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 141.4 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.00014 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.00014 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.01584 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.01584 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.01584 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 15.84 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 15.84 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.584 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 141.4 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 1.584 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.584/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**22 * 1.012 = 47.039.
Hence, the GFR value is 47.039 ml/min/1.73 m²."

There was no history of fever, altered consciousness, seizures, or upper or lower limb weakness. The past medical history was unremarkable. At the time of examination, his BP was 240/130 mm Hg. The fundus examination revealed bilateral papilledema with grade 4 hypertensive changes. The neurological examination revealed normal grade 5 power in all four limbs with normally elicited deep tendon reflexes. The sensory examination was unremarkable with normal flexor plantar response bilaterally. Serum electrolytes were normal; kidney function tests were deranged (blood urea 86 mg/dL, serum creatinine 3.7 mg/dL). A renal biopsy revealed features of IgA nephropathy. MRI of the brain revealed a hyperintense signal of medulla and cervical cord on T2 and FLAIR images (Figures ); small hyperintense foci were also noted in the parieto-occipital regions and deep cerebellar white matter. The lesions were also hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (because of T2 shine-through); there was no evidence of restricted diffusion on apparent diffusion co-efficient maps. As there was no clinical or lab evidence to support the diagnosis of encephalomyelitis or acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) as suggested initially by the radiologist, an atypical variant of PRES was considered as the most plausible diagnostic possibility. Further investigations including CSF studies were not considered necessary in view of the strongly suggestive clinical and imaging features.

In the first physical exam he presented hypotension and mental confusion. Three months before he began with progressive prostration, unintentional weight loss of 15 kg, intermittent fever, and night sweats. He was evaluated at an external hematology clinic 2 weeks before to come at our service and was diagnosed with multiple myeloma based on laboratory tests and bone marrow biopsy.
At initial physical examination, he had a temperature of 36.3 °C, a pulse of 81 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 incursions per minute, a peripheral oxygen saturation of 94% in ambient air, a blood pressure of 86/51 mmHg, and a slower peripheral perfusion (4 seconds). He had significant skin-mucous pallor, jaundice 2+/4+, lowered level of consciousness (Glasgow 14), mental confusion, and flapping in the upper extremities. The rest of the physical examination showed no other significant changes.
Initial laboratory evaluation revealed: hemoglobin (Hb) 9.7 g/L, hematocrit (Ht) 28.2%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 82.7 fl, white blood count (WBC) 3.02 × 109/L, neutrophils: 2.3 × 109/L, lymphocytes: 0.5 × 109/L, platelets: 39 × 109/L, Na++ 127 mEq/L, K+ 4.3 mEq/L, total Ca++ 9.3 mg/L, P 3.1 mg/L, creatinine 1.84 mg/dL, BUN 122 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 648 U/L, and C-protein reactive (CPR) 58.1 mg/L. Hepatic profile showed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 258 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 213 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 386 U/L, gamma GT 473 U/L, total bilirubin: 2.95 mg dL (direct bilirubin [DB]: 2.29 /indirect bilirubin [IB]: 0.66), albumin 2.4 g/dL, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR): 1.27, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ratio = 1.23. Laboratory evolution throughout hospitalization is summarized in Table .
In the emergency department, peripheral blood and urine cultures were collected and intravenous saline fluid and ceftriaxone was administered for treatment of supposed infectious etiologies. After initial measurements, blood pressure was normalized and the patient was stabilized. In his previous medical history, he had systemic arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure caused by recurrent nephrolithiasis. He used carvedilol 25 mg twice daily, spironolactone 25 mg once daily, ivabradine 5 mg twice daily, AAS 100 mg daily, and rosuvastatin 10 mg daily.
The patient had external laboratory tests showing 0.8 g/dL of monoclonal protein, IgA kappa paraprotein at serum immunofixation, serum IgA of 1038 mg/dL (70–400 mg/dL), and β2 microglobulin of 20.61 mg/L (0.8–2.2 mg/L). Bone marrow biopsy was hypercellular with monoclonal plasma cell proliferation CD56 (+), kappa light chain restriction, representing 30% of the total nucleated cells. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) Durie Salmon IIIA, ISS III was established in this moment.
Chest, abdomen, and pelvic computerized tomography (CT) revealed multiple lymphadenopathies up to 5.0 cm and splenomegaly. Positron emission CT with 18-fluoro deoxyglucose (18-FDG-PETCT) showed multiple lymphadenopathies in the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with SUVmax 12.0, liver FDG uptake 15.8 (SUVmax), and 16.4 cm splenomegaly with 15.8 spleen FDG uptake (Fig. ). Echocardiography was negative for endocarditis.
There was negativity for viral hepatitis B and C serology as well as for HIV, HTLV1, chickenpox, toxoplasmosis, herpes, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, enterovirus, paraecovirus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Blood cultures were negative. As the patient persisted with fever, ceftriaxone introduced at admission was replaced by Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Teicoplanin. However, the patient evolved quickly with multiorgan dysfunction characterized by liver and renal failure, LDH increase, and coagulopathy characterized by prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, and factor V reduction keeping factor VIII level between the normal range values (Table ).
As the clinician suspected of concurrent HLH further tests showed serum ferritin level of 47.502 ng/mL (30–400 ng/mL) and slight elevation of triglycerides. A new bone marrow aspiration confirmed the presence of 21.6% of aberrant plasma cells with significant macrophage activity with several haemophagocytosis pictures (Fig. ). Immunophenotyping demonstrated 4.9% of anomalous and monoclonal plasma cells expressing CD45dim, CD19partial, CD38bright, CD138bright, CD56dim, CD117dim, and kappa light chain restriction in cytoplasm. Thereafter, the patient was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit and pulse therapy with methylprednisolone 1 g/d for 3 days was administered to control HLH. Afterwards the patient received cyclophosphamide at dose of 500 mg once weekly and dexamethasone 20 mg once daily D1–D4 as anti-multiple myeloma treatment. We were not able to investigate lymphadenopathy because the patient became soon hemodynamically unstable, requiring mechanical ventilation support and renal replacement therapy with hemodialysis.

Although diagnosed with atrial septal defect (ASD) 30 years previously, the patient elected not to undergo surgical repair. Approximately 1 year prior, he began to visit the pediatric ward of Samsung Medical Center more frequently with symptoms of palpitations and dyspnea lasting 2 to 3 days and occurring in 2- to 3-month intervals. An electrocardiogram showed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and secundum-type ASD (22.3 mm) with a left-to-right shunt was diagnosed by echocardiogram. Device closure (Amplatzer septal occlude 28 mm; AGA Medical, Golden Valley, MN, USA) was then performed; however, 1 week after the procedure, the patient continued to experience dyspnea and chest pain after 10 to 20 minutes of walking. Sustained atrial fibrillation was seen on the electrocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor. Cardioversion was performed following hospitalization with the opinion that the persistent atrial fibrillation was due to device closure. The patient was discharged from the hospital after cardioversion to sinus rhythm at 100 J; however, the symptoms recurred. Since it was difficult to perform radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) due to the recent device closure, the patient was referred to the thoracic surgery department for totally thoracoscopic ablation. Surgery was performed under routine procedures. Intubation was performed using a double lumen endotracheal tube. For the surgery, a 10-mm trocar was inserted in the fourth intercostal space (ICS) of the right anterior axillary line, a 5-mm trocar in the third ICS along the anterior axillary line, and a 10-mm trocar in the sixth ICS on the mid-axillary line. Right pulmonary vein ablation, right ganglionated plexi ablation, and ablation of the right half of the space between the right lower pulmonary vein and the left lower pulmonary vein were performed. Between the procedures, we conducted a high-frequency stimulation test for finding ganglionated plexi. Sutures were placed after chest tube insertion. On the left side, ports were placed in the same positions, and ablations were performed in the same order as on the right side after dividing Marshall’s ligament (). A left atrial auricle resection was then performed using an Echelon Flex 60 articulating endoscopic linear cutter (Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA). Upon confirmation of the conversion to sinus rhythm, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. He was then transferred to the general ward on postoperative day 1 and discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 6. During this 6-day postoperative period, the sinus rhythm was maintained continuously. Six months later, the sinus rhythm was seen on the 24-hour Holter monitor; the patient showed none of the earlier symptoms, and therefore, amiodarone and warfarin were stopped.

58,4,CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk,risk,integer,pmc-7229273-1,Extracted,"The patient was a 76-year-old man with a history of mild dysphasia. He had a prior history of cerebral infarctions (x3) at the age of 66, 74 and 75 years, with a first instance of swallowing difficulties after the third stroke. At that time, dysphasia rehabilitation was initiated within 3 days of the stroke, and he recovered the ability to eat a regular meal within 2 weeks. In January 2018, 1-year after his last stroke, he underwent surgery for spinal stenosis, followed by a 10-day period of bedrest. His physical activity level subsequently declined due to back pain, and he lost 10 kg within the 10 months after surgery. Swallowing difficulties re-emerged in September 2018, with the patient only able to tolerate soft meals. His dysphasia worsened, with an increase in sputum and development of a chronic cough.
His medical history included cerebral infarctions (x3), diabetes mellitus, spinal stenosis, and hypertension. His height was 168.8 cm, with a body weight of 56.5 kg. He had a right hemiplegia, with the following functional measures: grip strength, 25 kg; gait speed, 0.7 m/s, assessed using the 5-m walk test; and skeletal mass index, 6.6 kg/m2. His score of 5 points on the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form was indicative of malnourishment. Absence of another cerebral infarct was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Video-endoscopic swallowing assessment showed saliva pooling in the pharynx, widening of the pharyngeal space, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A). Video-fluorography revealed a decrease in the forward movement of the larynx, a widened pharyngeal space, weakened pharyngeal constriction, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A–C). Functional swallowing scores were as follows: Hyodo score, 9; Fujishima grade, 6; FILS, 8; and dysphasia severity scale, 4. A probable diagnosis of sarcopenic dysphagia was made, based on the criteria defined by Mori et al. [] Clinical management included swallowing training, a high-protein diet, and nutritional guidance. The patient declined additional rehabilitation, due to his previous experience post-stroke. Therefore, we presented laryngeal suspension as a possible alternative treatment, which was performed in December 2018.
Laryngeal suspension was performed via a minimally invasive thyromadibulopexy, using two skin incisions: one (2-cm) incision at the level of the mandible and the other (3-cm) between the hyoid bone and the superior border of the thyroid cartilage (A). Identified the white line, divided aside the anterior cervical muscles, and exposed the thyroid cartilage. Also the mandible was exposed. Two holes in the mandibular and six holes in the thyroid cartilage was made by using drill. The thyroid cartilage was fixed to the mandible using No. 2 nylon. No. 2 nylon thread was passed through the Gore-tex sheet cut to the size of thyroid cartilage. And it was passed through the thyroid cartilage, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, mandible, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, and tied to the other side of the nylon. As the two holes of the middle of the thyroid cartilage, two No. 2 nylons was crossed to fix the thyroid cartilage and mandible. The larynx was suspended about one vertebral body by totally using five No. 2 nylons (B), confirmed by X-ray fluoroscopy. A 1-cm incision was performed for tracheotomy, and cuffed tracheal cannula was inserted for airway management.
Maintaining some neck flexion for a period of 1-week was conducted. Nutritional support was initiated via gastrostomy tube feeding. The cuffed tracheal cannula was changed to an uncuffed cannula on postoperative day (POD) 1. The wound was stable and there was no pain. Swallowing was initiated using jelly and cold tea, with the patient in a flat lateral position. The tracheal cannula was removed on POD 4. Video-fluorography revealed contrast agent residue in the vallecular but with a decrease in residue in the pyriform sinus compared to pre-operative measures, with no evidence of aspiration on POD 6 (A–C). Anterosuperior movement of the larynx was improved, reaching one vertebral level higher than before surgery. The swallowing reflex was maintained, with sufficient opening of the esophageal orifice, avoiding the need for mandibular protrusion to swallow. Swallowing using modified food was initiated in a sitting position on POD 6 and the gastrostomy tube was removed on POD 7. Video-endoscopic examination confirmed his ability to eat a rice cracker and noodles without aspiration and no evidence of pharyngeal residue on POD 11 (B). The patient was able to eat soft meals on POD 14, and a regular meal on POD 18, and was discharged on POD 21. The patient gained 2 kg in the 2 months after surgery, with improvement in functional scores: Hyodo score, 5; Fujishima grade, 8; FILS, 8; and dysphasia severity scale, 6. There was no exacerbation of the condition over a 10-month period after surgery, and the patient has a normal diet and is able to travel.

She was lethargic, confused, and was not answering questions appropriately for the past four days. On arrival, she was afebrile, and her vitals included a pulse of 139 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/79 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with saturation of 96% on room air. Physical exam was significant for a slow to respond female, orientated to self, who was able to follow commands with no focal neurological deficit. Her skin was warm and well-perfused with normal capillary refill, with no rashes or petechiae. The cardiovascular exam was significant for tachycardia, an irregular heart rhythm, and a systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border. She had lower extremity pitting edema bilaterally. Her lab results were notable for elevated white blood cell count (WBC) 25.2 x 103 μL (3.9-11.3 x 103 μL), hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL (11.3-15.1 g/dL), platelets 58.0 x 103 μL (165-366 x 103 μL), troponin 0.164 ng/mL (<0.010 ng/mL), lactic acid 2.5 mmol/L (0.5-2.0 mmol/L), and a basic chemistry panel was within normal limits. The urinalysis was remarkable for the presence of WBCs, leukocyte esterase, and bacteria with a urine culture pending. Additionally, two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Her electrocardiogram was significant for atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate (RVR). She was started on ceftriaxone for probable UTI and was admitted to the hospital for further management. Further diagnostics included lower extremity Doppler ultrasound, which revealed deep venous thrombosis (DVT). A bedside echocardiogram indicated right ventricular strain, and the N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide level was elevated at 8,215 pg/mL (<449 pg/mL). Due to concern for possible pulmonary embolism in the setting of known DVT, the patient was started on a continuous heparin infusion. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe aortic valve calcification with new aortic insufficiency. Blood and urine cultures returned positive for Aerococcus urinae. A transesophageal echocardiogram further confirmed moderate to severe aortic regurgitation with findings suggestive of infective endocarditis (IE).
Antibiotics were expanded to include gentamicin with ceftriaxone for IE, and surgical evaluation was consulted. Given she was a high-risk surgical candidate, surgery intervention was not offered at this time unless evidence of further clinical decompensation. Additional surgical recommendations included re-evaluation after completion of antibiotic course.

Over the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks. She lived alone and had a history of hypertension for almost thirteen years for which she was noncompliant with her medications. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension and died at the age of 80 years from heart disease.
On examination, her temperature was 37°C, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute. Her blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter. Oxygen saturation was 100 percent on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.
Physical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density. She was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and workup.
Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no obvious lesion. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute with no ST or T wave changes. A 24-hour holter monitoring was performed which revealed sinus bradycardia without other arrhythmias.
Her laboratory studies were as shown in .
Serum alcohol levels were undetectable and urine toxicology was negative. Esophagogastro-dudodenoscopy was performed and the gastric biopsy was suggestive of chronic atrophy of the body and fundus. The endoscopic findings were further reinforced by high serum levels of antibodies to intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells confirming malabsorption of vitamin B12 due to lack of intrinsic factor. Thus, the diagnosis of pernicious anemia was established.
The patient was started on intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1,000 μg) daily for one week, then weekly for one month. She was later lost to followup, and posttreatment evaluation of the skin hyperpigmentation and neurological evaluation could not be done.",What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?

Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Arterial blood gas showed a pH 7.33, paCO2 68.5 and paO2 88.6 on FiO2 of 40%. Electrocardiogram confirmed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Echocardiogram revealed a myopathic severely enlarged left ventricular chamber with moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and severe global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 8 to 10%. The patient's work of breathing and oxygenation improved with Bipap. He was started on diltiazem and diuresis was initiated. The patient was admitted to the step-down unit with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.
On hospital day number eight, the overnight nurse found the patient unresponsive. A code blue was called. His initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation and he was shocked with 200 J twice before regaining pulses. When stabilised, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he regained consciousness and full neurologic function within one hour of the event. The following day, an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) was placed. Intraoperatively, the patient had runs of ventricular tachycardia with hypotension to 80 mmHg systolic. Postoperatively, the patient was found to have a right fixed mid-dilated pupil, flaccid paralysis of the left arm and leg with hyperreflexia throughout the left side. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed a right midbrain and thalamic stroke thought to be secondary to transient arrhythmia-induced hypoperfusion, intraoperatively.
On postoperative day number three, after AICD placement and stroke, the patient acutely developed a rigid distended board-like abdomen with dullness to percussion. Vitals at that time were temperature, 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit; blood pressure, 112/67 mmHg; heart rate range, 55 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 26 on ventilator settings of assist control volume control with a rate of 26; tidal volume, 500 ml; FiO2, 40% and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5. His peak inspiratory pressure on the ventilator had risen from 26 to 72 mmHg; his plateau had risen from 15 to 48 mmHg with oxygen desaturation from 93 to 85%. The patient had received 1.5 l in and urinated 4.5 l over the 24 hours, leading up to this event. His laboratory values from that morning were unchanged from previous (white blood count, 10 400/μl; haemoglobin, 12.6 g/dl; platelets, 200 000/μl; sodium, 139 mEq/l; potassium, 4.7 mEq/l; chloride, 100 mEq/l; bicarbonate, 34 mEq/l; BUN, 36 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.41 mg/dl; glucose, 78 mg/dl; calcium, 8.3 mg/dl; magnesium, 2.0 mEq/l; phosphorus, 3.0 mg/dl; AST, 77 U/l; ALT, 94 U/l; alkaline phosphatase, 186 U/l; total bilirubin, 1.3 mg/dl). This constellation of findings prompted the team to measure an abdominal compartment pressure which was elevated to 53 cm H2O (40 mmHg) with an abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) of 42 mmHg. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed which showed no dilated loops of bowel, no ileus, no evidence of free air, abscess or obstruction and minimal free fluid []. Pertinent labs from the event revealed a lactate of 1.0 mg/dl; lipase, 159 U/l; amylase, 76 U/l; creatinine, 1.53 mg/dl. Surgery was consulted and the FiO2 was increased to 100%, which improved his oxygen saturation to 96% despite his elevated peak inspiratory pressures.
Surgical recommendations were for an emergent bedside surgical abdominal decompression. The patient was administered 10 mg of intravenous cisatracurium besylate by anaesthesia in preparation for surgical management. Shortly following paralytic administration, his peak inspiratory pressure corrected from 72 to 23 mmHg, his plateau pressure from 48 to 16 mmHg and his oxygenation status tolerated a decrease in FiO2 down to 40% with his oxygen saturation returning to baseline. Measurement of his abdominal compartment pressure revealed a drop from 53 (40 mmHg) to 23 cm H2O (17 mmHg) and then normalised to 15 cm H20 (11 mmHg) over a three-hour period. During this entire event, the patient averaged 100 to 200 cc/hr of urine output and laboratory values from the following day showed a drop in creatinine from 1.53 to 1.29 mg/dl. Given this correction, surgical management was postponed and the patient was monitored. The patient remained hospitalised for an additional 73 days.

When he was being treated for pneumonia at another hospital, CT image incidentally revealed a BT and mild right-sided hydronephrosis (Fig. ) without metastasis. After his pneumonia had been cured, the patient was referred to the SIMC to receive treatment for his BT (SIMC-Uro# 11116, a unique non-sequential patient control number issued at the Department of Uro-Oncology, SIMC). At his first visit, the patient's physical (height: 1.56 m, weight: 48.9 kg) and routine laboratory data were within the normal ranges. He had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, which required regular insulin injections. MRI showed many BTs (Figs –). The largest tumor detected on MRI is indicated by the blue arrowhead in Figure a. The tumor indicated by the yellow arrowhead was observed as it progressed between the right ureteral wall (white arrowhead in Figure a) and bladder wall (red arrowhead). Moreover, a tumor was found within the right orifice of the ureter (green arrowhead), which had presumably caused the mild right-sided hydroureter (“u” in Figure a, see also Figures –). Thus, the patient was diagnosed with bladder carcinoma, which was suspected to have infiltrated into the ureter (green arrowhead). No apparent muscle invasion, lymph node metastasis, or distant metastasis was observed (clinical classification: T1, N0, M0, according to the classification of the Union for International Cancer Control).
The patient underwent oral-PDD-TUR-BT (20 mg/kg of 5-ALA was administered 2 hours before surgery) using the D-LIGHT system (Table ). As suggested by MRI (blue arrowhead in Figure a), the main papillary tumor was located on the right ureteral orifice (blue arrowhead in Figure b), and it clearly emitted fluorescence under blue light (Fig. c). It had invaded the bladder neck, the prostatic urethra, and the right posterior wall of the bladder (Video ). In addition, three daughter tumors were found on the posterior wall of the bladder (Video ). Random bladder biopsy samples were obtained from the surrounding normal tissue (the posterior, left, and right walls) and the tumor-infiltrated tissue (the bladder neck and prostatic urethra). Subsequently, we deeply resected the largest tumor (Fig. b,c). The right ureteral orifice was exposed, and it was found to have been blocked by papillary tumors (the tumors in the ureter and the ureteral wall are indicated by green and white arrowheads, respectively; Fig. d,e). We deeply resected the tumors in the ureteral orifice; however, after the resection procedure residual tumors were identified within the ureteral orifice (green arrowhead in Figure f), which emitted potent fluorescence under blue light (Fig. g, see also Video ). We decided to attempt to remove the remaining tumors. After the second and third attempts to resect the ureteral tumors (deep resections, Video ), no tumors were visible under white light in the right ureter (Fig. h); however, marked fluorescence was observed from the ureteral mucosa (Fig. i), which was indicative of residual cancer. If the patient had undergone TUR without PDD, we would have finished the surgery at this point. Instead, we performed a biopsy of the fluorescence-emitting tissue. We then attempted to remove the suspected residual carcinoma. After the fourth resection of the ureteral orifice, the hydroureter-affected lumen was exposed, the mucosa of which was smooth and did not emit fluorescence (Fig. j,k). Subsequently, we performed a biopsy of the ureteral mucosa (Video ).
The pathological diagnosis of the BT was low-grade urothelial carcinoma, which had not invaded the muscular layer (pTa). No cancer cells were detected in random biopsy specimens. As expected from the PDD, low-grade cancer cells were detected in the ureteral mucosa after the third resection of the ureteral orifice, in which an irregular and fluorescent mucosa was identified (Fig. h,i). On the other hand, no cancer cells were found in the smooth and non-fluorescent mucosa after the fourth resection procedure. To prevent tumor recurrence, the patient is currently being treated with intravesically administered BCG via a right ureteral stent, which exposes both the ureter and the bladder to BCG. We concluded that the ureteral tumor was a BT that had infiltrated into the ureter because (i) preoperative MRI (Fig. a) showed that the main tumor was located in the bladder, (ii) the hydronephrosis was mild (CT findings, Figure ; the hydronephrosis would have been severe if the ureteral tumor had originated from the ureteral orifice), and (iii) the pathological analyses did not show muscular invasion.

He had no respiratory, neurological, rheumatological, ophthalmologic, or dermatological symptoms. Physical examination showed a pale child with weight and height both below the 3rd percentile for age. Laboratory investigations were remarkable for anemia (hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL), ESR 114 mm/h, serum calcium 2.26 mmol/L, and low albumin level 28 g/L. Endoscopy revealed an erosive, friable, and nodular gastric mucosa over the entire stomach. Histopathology of biopsies revealed chronic noncaseating granulomatous inflammation []. Special stains and cultures for acid-fast and fungal microorganisms showed negative results. Colonoscopy was normal including terminal ileum. CT scan of the chest and abdomen demonstrated multiple, small, centrolobularly distributed nodules within the acini of both lungs and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Ophthalmological examination showed evidence of uveitis. ACE level was elevated at 135 U/L. Similar to Case 1, extensive investigations for infectious, immunologic, and inflammatory conditions associated with GIT granulomatous inflammation were negative.
The combination of tissue findings of granulomatous disease from upper GIT, elevated ACE, systemic involvement, and negative workup for infectious disease suggested systemic sarcoidosis with significant GI involvement. The patient received corticosteroids at 1 mg/kg/day and omeprazole, resulting in resolution of GI symptoms and normalization of activity markers and ACE level. Tapering of corticosteroids over 3 months led to relapse of the disease. Again, remission was induced by a course of steroids supplemented by mesalamine (Pentasa 50 mg/kg/day) and azathioprine (up to 2.5 mg/kg/day) to maintain remission. Throughout the 4-year follow up, the course of the disease was punctuated by several relapses on tapering of corticosteroids and later development of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia: hemoglobin 10.6 gm/dL, macrocytosis (MCV 102, normal 80–91 fL), hyperchromasia (MCH 34.5, normal 20–31 pg), low serum vitamin B12 119.2 pmol/L (normal 162–638 pmol/L). Red blood cell folate level was normal at 16.2 nmol/L (normal, 10.4–42.2 nmol/L). Antigastric parietal cell antibodies were negative. The patient received weekly injections of vitamin B12 ( 1 mg weekly) for 6 weeks that raised the level to 231.8 pmol/L with correction of anemia and normalization of his peripheral blood picture.
Considering the steroid dependency of the disease and the short stature of the patient, he was commenced on infliximab 5 mg/kg administered intravenously at 0, 2 and 6 weeks and then every 8 weeks. The patient reported a significant subjective general improvement as well as resolution of his GI symptoms. ESR and ACE concentration returned to normal. A repeat of endoscopy after the 6th dose of infliximab infusion demonstrated loss of gastric folds pattern and loss of normal vascular pattern; otherwise there were no more erosions or friability. Biopsies from the gastric mucosa showed a marked reduction of inflammation, atrophic gastric glands, and absence of granulomas. At 5 years posttreatment with infliximab, the patient remains in remission off corticosteroids.","Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

The patient's normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL.
The concentration of albmumin is 28.0 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 28.0 g albmumin/10.0 dL = 2.8 g albmumin/dL. The concentration value of 28.0 g albmumin/L converts to 2.8 g albmumin/dL. 
The concentration of calcium is 2.26 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of calcium from mmol to mg. The mass of calcium is 2.26 mmol. To convert 2.26 mmol of calcium to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 2.26 mmol calcium * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.00226 mol calcium. To convert from mol calcium to grams, multiply by the molar mass 40.08 g/mol, which will give 0.00226 mol calcium * 40.08 g/mol = 0.09058 g calcium. To convert 0.09058 g of calcium to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.09058 g calcium * 1000.0 mg/g = 90.58 mg calcium. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 90.58 mg calcium/10.0 dL = 9.058 mg calcium/dL. The concentration value of 2.26 mmol calcium/L converts to 9.058 mg calcium/dL. 
Plugging these values into the formula, we get (0.8 * (4.0 g/dL - 2.8 g/dL)) + 9.058 mg/dL = 10.018 mg/dL.

Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH of 7.36, pCO2 of 25 mm Hg, pO2 of 90.3 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. There was an anion gap of 20, lactic acid of 4.8 mmoles/L, serum lipase of 1540 U/L, amylase 406 unit/L, gamma GT 25 unit/L, INR 1.3, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 950 unit/L; cancer antigen CA 19-9 was 49.9 μ/mL, TSH was 2.25 mIU/L, serum acetone was negative, and alcohol level was less than 10 mg/dL. His serial cardiac enzymes were negative and he was ruled out for an acute coronary event.
Chest X-ray (CXR) revealed bilateral patchy airspace disease. CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with homogeneous attenuation and without significant peripancreatic inflammation () with extensive retroperitoneal and pelvic adenopathy (). A para-aortic lymph node measuring 2.1 cm and retrocaval lymph node measuring 1.6 cm were seen. A soft tissue density surrounding the right common iliac vessels likely representing confluent adenopathy was seen. His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 67%; right ventricle systolic pressure was estimated to be 44 mm Hg. Pericardium was normal without any pericardial effusion. There was no significant valvular abnormality.
Initially, the patients EKG showed 2nd degree Mobitz type I block which later progressed to complete heart block. Patient was given atropine without improvement; hence, a temporary pacemaker was inserted. He was started on IV hydration and IV antibiotics and all his electrolyte abnormalities were corrected. His temporary pacemaker lead came out and it was removed. Subsequently he became unresponsive, was orally intubated, had four cardiac arrests, and was successfully resuscitated. Due to persistent pulmonary infiltrates he underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies which showed evidence of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP). He was started on Bactrim for the treatment of PJP. He tested positive for HIV and was found to have a CD 4 count of 12/uL.
A temporary pacemaker wire was again placed after ruling out the relevant reversible causes of third degree heart block. A repeat echocardiogram was unchanged from prior one. CT-guided biopsy of the para-aortic lymph nodes was consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with marked tumor necrosis (). Immunoprofile showed that CD 20 (), CD 79a, and CD 10 were positive. CD 43, CD 3, CD 7, and BcL were negative. Upper endoscopy for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement showed gastric polyps which revealed gastric lymphoma on biopsy.

He also had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and was undergoing radiation therapy for prostate cancer. He had never smoked and his family history was unremarkable. He became aware of dyspnea on exertion in the previous 2 months, and was admitted to our hospital because his condition worsened. UCG revealed that the LVEF had decreased sharply from 73 to 44% (New York Heart Association class III). In this case, the inflammatory response remained low and stable at C-reactive protein levels of 0.3 to 0.5 mg/dL until the second operation.
His height and weight were 170.0 cm and 64.4 kg, respectively. His blood pressure was 86/48 mmHg and heart rate was 70 bpm (normal sinus rhythm).

ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm with Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF, and ST segment depression in V5-V6 (Fig. ). Chest radiography and CT revealed a CTR of 72% and severe calcified coronary arteries (Fig. ). UCG revealed poor left ventricular function (LVDd/Ds, 56/43 mm; LVEF, 44%; inferoposterior wall hypokinesis; and mild MR with RVP of 29 mmHg). Cineangiography 4 years ago had shown only 25% stenosis in the proximal LAD; at admission, it revealed 90% stenosis in the same proximal LAD, 99% stenosis in the proximal LCX, and 95% stenosis in the posterolateral branch (PL) of LCX (Fig. a, b). He had low blood pressure during dialysis and underwent emergency surgery (Euro II risk score 40.7%; STS risk score, 33.2%).
We performed a sternotomy similar to the one performed previously, and then performed CABG (LITA-LAD, and LITA-right internal thoracic artery [right internal thoracic artery, RITA-Diagonal branch-PL1-PL-2-PL3]). The duration of surgery and CPB was 514 and 172 min, respectively. The postoperative ventilator management was completed in 9 h.

It was found that the patient had osteoporosis in her history but did not receive any treatment. In the physical examination of the patient, who did not present any characteristics in her family history, the liver extended to 2 cm below the costal margin. She did not have ascites or splenomegaly. Heart and lung examinations were normal. Laboratory tests presented a normal hemogram. Biochemical tests revealed an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 50 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 20 U/L, total bilirubin level of 1.3 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level of 101 U/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase level of 227 U/L, albumin level of 2.6 g/dL, total protein level of 4.9 g/dL, calcium level of 12.35 mg/dL, and a phosphate level of 2.6 mg/dL. The patient was hospitalized in order to investigate the etiology of hypercalcemia. The patient had a parathormone level of 9.5 pg/mL. These results excluded a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The patient who was thought to have malignant hypercalcemia was started on intravenous fluid replacement and furosemide treatment. The patient who manifested a creatinine clearance of 55.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 was started on 2 mg zoledronic acid treatment. Tomography scans demonstrated no osteolytic bone lesions. During follow-up, the patient's calcium levels regressed to 9.7 mg/dL with the specified treatment. Abdominal ultrasonography performed due to right upper quadrant pain and hepatomegaly revealed multiple hypoechoic images in the liver, of which the largest was 1.5 cm in size, and a coarsely granular parenchyma. The dynamic CT of the patient demonstrated hypodense lesions with multiple areas of peripheral contrast enhancement that were particularly congregated in the right lobe, the largest of which had a size of 47 × 32 mm, and this was interpreted as metastasis (Figure ).
Levels of alpha-fetoprotein were determined as 91 ng/mL, cancer antigen (CA-125) as 258.6 U/mL, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as 0.82 ng/mL, and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) as 2.1 U/mL.

There was no history of fever, arthralgia, myalgia, or rashes.
In the emergency department, the patient was afebrile, blood pressure was 85/49 mm Hg, heart rate was 150 per minute, and respiratory rate was 22 per minute, with oxygen saturation of 94% on six liters of oxygen via a nasal cannula. The patient appeared lethargic and was using accessory muscles for respiration. General examination showed pallor. The oral mucosa was dry, with a thickly coated tongue. The neck veins were flat. Heart examination revealed a fast, irregular heart rate, variable first heart sound, and normal second heart sound without any murmurs or gallops. Lung examination revealed bilateral mid to late inspiratory crackles. The abdomen was soft, distended, non-tender, with normal bowel sounds. Extremities were noted to be cold, with 1+ pitting edema and normal capillary refill time.
Routine laboratory investigations revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.5 (4.0-10.5 k/uL), hemoglobin of 9.9 (12.5-16 g/dL), and hematocrit of 32.3 (37-47%). Her baseline hemoglobin concentration was around 15 g/dL. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 101.9 (78-100 fL) with elevated mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) of 34 (25-33 pg) and normal mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) of 33.4 (32-36 g/dL). Platelet count was 34 (150-450 K/uL), with elevated mean platelet volume (MPV) of 12.4 (7.4-11.4 fL). Peripheral blood smear showed intracytoplasmic parasites suspicious for Babesia along with reduced platelets (Figure ). The parasitic level was found to be at 9.04%. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 1544 U/L (125-220 U/L), haptoglobin was <6 mg/dL (27-139 mg/dL), total bilirubin was 5.4 mg/dL (0.3-1.0 mg/dL), with a direct fraction of 3.5 mg/dL (0.0-0.2 mg/dL).

The chest X-ray was remarkable for cardiomegaly with a small right pleural effusion and small airspace opacity within the right lower lobe concerning for consolidation or segmental atelectasis. Given her presentation, she was started on intravenous fluids along with empiric antibiotic coverage for community-acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. As the peripheral smear was remarkable for Babesia, she was started on atovaquone and doxycycline for a possible co-infection with Lyme. Blood titers for Anaplasma and Lyme were sent. Positive pressure ventilation was started to help with respiratory distress. She received intravenous fluids; however, she continued to remain hypotensive and required norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. Given the severity of her disease and parasitic load, a decision was made to do erythrocytapheresis.
Following erythrocytapheresis, the parasitic load decreased to 5.54%. The patient remained in shock and clindamycin was added to the regimen. Her renal function worsened, which was believed to be secondary to pigment-induced nephropathy from hemolysis. Due to the inadequate response and development of acute kidney injury, repeat erythrocytapheresis was performed, resulting in a reduction in parasite load to 1.75%. At this point, Lyme immunoglobulin M (IgM) immunoblot was found to be positive, with negative immunoglobulin G (IgG). Anaplasma titers also showed recent/current infection, with IgG >1:1024 (reference <1:64) and IgM 1:80 (reference <1:20). Atovaquone and azithromycin were discontinued and quinine was added. Her hemodynamic status improved and she was titrated off of vasopressor support along with an improvement in respiratory status.

135,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,integer,pmc-5837304-1,Extracted,"A 41-year-old female patient with a past medical history of bipolar disorder, cocaine use disorder, and tobacco use disorder, presented with increased respiratory distress and combativeness. On initial examination, her vital signs included a temperature of 100.9°F, heart rate of 140 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute and blood pressure of 103/66 mmHg. On physical examination, she was only able to speak in two-word sentences. There were bilateral coarse crackles all over the chest. She did not have any focal neurological deficits. Cardiovascular examination did not reveal abnormal heart sounds. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. The patient was immediately placed on a nonrebreather mask. However, the patient kept taking off her nonrebreather mask, continued to have worsening hypoxia, and eventually required tracheal intubation. Chest radiograph showed right upper lobe pneumonia (Figure ).
She was started on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin, and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was chosen due to patient's critical condition and unclear etiology of the infecting pathogen. The patient had a white cell count of 11.8 x 103/microliter (µL) that trended to 2.2 x 103/µL, normal troponins, and a lactic acid of 1.8 mmol/Liter (L) initially that trended up to 2.5 mmol/L. Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine, benzodiazepine, and opiates. Urine Legionella antigen and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen were negative. Influenza A was positive on rapid antigen testing and the patient was started on oseltamivir. This raised our concern for secondary bacterial pneumonia from MRSA as a complication of influenza virus infection. The patient had computed tomography (CT) of the chest that showed right upper, middle, and lower lobe consolidations with cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma (Figures , ).
Sputum culture and blood cultures grew MRSA that was sensitive to both vancomycin and clindamycin, confirming our diagnosis. Vancomycin had already been started on admission and was continued. Fluid resuscitation was also done early in the course, but eventually progressed to septic shock. The patient was then started on norepinephrine infusion and vasopressin infusion for blood pressure support. She then developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her hypoxia became refractory to conventional ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was considered. She had a transesophageal echocardiogram which showed severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 5%. Her cardiomyopathy was felt to be acute and related to sepsis. She was managed for septic and cardiogenic shock, and venous-arterial ECMO was started. She was also started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for hypervolemia refractory to diuresis, inotropic and vasopressor support. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) five days later showed that the EF recovered to 45%. She continued to remain intubated for 16 days and a repeat CT chest showed worsening and multiple cavitary lesions in the right lung (Figures , ).
A repeat TTE showed EF of 60% and normal left and right heart function. ECMO was stopped and she was decannulated on day 9, CRRT was stopped on day 9. Unfortunately, she did not tolerate withdrawal of ECMO and continued to deteriorate and became difficult to wean from the ventilator. Given her lack of response to vancomycin, she was switched to daptomycin and linezolid, and the vancomycin was discontinued. She did not improve with new antibiotic regimen, continued to accumulate volume, and could not tolerate being off CRRT that was resumed for volume removal. Her hypoxia continued to be refractory despite all efforts. The family eventually decided to transition to comfort care due to her poor prognosis.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?

The background included a history of persistent dry cough for 3 months without any other complaint or systemic symptoms. Her past medical history comprised of type 2 diabetes, increased uric acid and ongoing pain in the right knee. Her medication history consisted of gliclazide, allopurinol and diclofenac. The patient denied any recent travel or contact with animals (even pets). Physical examination revealed central cyanosis, tachypnoea, bilateral reduction in breath sounds and right-sided bronchial breathing. Cardiac examination was normal. There were no adenopathy noted. Arterial blood gases analysis on 5 litres of O2 per min showed mixed acidaemia. Serum biochemistry revealed raised urea (15.1 mmol/L) and creatinine (114 umol/L) levels consistent with acute kidney injury, positive D-dimmer's levels and increased CRP (48.2 mg/L). Chest radiography showed a loss of volume in the right lung (Figure ) and an electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 94 bpm, left axis deviation and an old inferior myocardial infarction. At this time the patient was started on treatment for both a possible community acquired pneumonia (benzyl penicillin and clarythromycin) and for pulmonary thromboembolism (therapeutic doses of Dalteparin). The patient was stable for 48 hours but then her oxygen requirements increased progressively. Contrast-enhanced chest CT scan and CT pulmonary arteriography with venous phase imaging failed to demonstrate any evidence of pulmonary artery thrombus. However thrombus, with associated fibrosis and volume loss, was seen to affect one of the right lower lobe pulmonary veins (Figure ). An echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal sized left ventricle with good function, normal aortic and mitral valves. The right heart although poorly visualized, appeared to be mildly enlarged with moderate function. The patient was started on methylprednisolone 1 g once a day and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).
The patient continued to deteriorate over the next 24 hours following admission to the ICU. She developed biochemical and electrocardiographic evidence of an acute anterior-lateral myocardial infarction and aspirin, clopidogrel and simvastatin were added to her anticoagulation therapy.

She had been diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus, mild chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure and stayed at a nursing home. She was a wheelchair-user. At the initial presentation, the patient had a body temperature of 40.2 °C, blood pressure of 183/81 mmHg, and pulse of 74 beats per min. Hypoxemia was not confirmed. The physical examination was unremarkable. Chest X-ray and urine test were normal. Laboratory tests revealed an elevation of blood urea nitrogen 23.8 mg/dl, creatinine 1.14 mg/dl and C-reactive protein 1.93 mg/dl. Platelet count was low at 105,000/μl. White cell count, hemoglobin and liver function tests were within normal range as shown in supplementary file. Two sets of blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi were drawn. Then, the patient was started empirically on meropenem and teicoplanin for broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. In addition to blood cultures, a urinalysis with culture and a chest X-ray and CT were performed and found to be normal. The patient had no clinically evident sites of infection by history or physical examination. On day 2, a coryneform organism was recovered for 32 h by BACTEC (BD, Tokyo, Japan) from both the aerobic and anaerobic tubes of all blood cultures. Brevibacterium species were identified by Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The score value was 2.36. On gram-stained smears from the culture plates, the organisms appeared as Gram-positive, club-shaped, slightly curved rods, and some coccal forms were present (Fig. a). The bacteria were subcultured on Trypticase Soy Agar II with 5% Sheep Blood (BD, Tokyo, Japan) at 35 °C in 5% CO2, which resulted in a gray-white, smooth, non-hemolytic colonies after a 48-incubation (Fig. b). Subsequently, genetic investigation by 16S ribosomal RNA analysis was performed in order to identify the organism. Finally, the result identified this pathogen as Brevibacterium paucivorans with 99.5% homology on the Ez taxon database ().
For comparison of a hydrolysis of casein in the organism, we obtained a type strain of B. casei, JCM 2594T and of B. paucivorans, JCM 11567T, from the Japan Collection of Microorganisms (JCM). Pyrazinamidase test was performed using PZA broth (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Casein hydrolysis test was performed as follows. 1) inoculate the organism on a skim milk agar, 2) incubate the plate at 37 °C, 3) examine the plate for zone of hydrolysis following incubation. Both the organism and JCM 11567T showed a lack of hydrolysis of casein, while a hydrolysis of casein was confirmed in JCM 2594T as shown in Fig. . The organism had an absence of pyrazinamidase, while JCM 2594T showed a presence of pyrazinamidase. Additional microbiological tests by API 50CH showed that utilization of D-arabinose and gluconate was negative. These results were consistent with the organism as B. paucivorans. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that the organism was susceptible to MEPM. Although the peripheral venous catheter site showed no erythema or tenderness, the catheter was removed without culture, and a follow-up blood culture remained negative after therapy lasting for 7 days. The patient’s fever finally abated and labs were also improved. On day 14, the antibiotic therapy was discontinued. On day 28 from admission, fever recurred and blood cultures were performed. Candida parapsilosis was isolated by 2 sets of blood cultures, and she was diagnosed as having candidemia. While L-AMB was started for Candida parapsilosis bacteremia, she died by candidemia on day 35.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for the strain using the broth microdilution method (Dry Plate®, Eiken Chemical co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines []. The isolate was susceptible to gentamicin [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 1 μg/ml], ciplofloxacin (MIC = 0.25 μg/ml), vancomycin (MIC≦0.5 μg/ml), meropenem (MIC≦0.5 μg/ml) and rifampicin (MIC≦0.12 μg/ml), and was resistant to clindamycin (MIC> 4 μg/ml), and was intermediately resistant to ceftriaxone (MIC = 2 μg/ml),and cefepim (MIC = 2 μg/ml) as shown in Table .","Using the MDRD GFR Equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?

168,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-4805055-1,Extracted,"We present a 15-year-old boy who was admitted to our hospital with significant weight loss, malaise, and cold intolerance. Written informed consent for presentation was obtained from the patient and his parents.
The patient weighed 102 kg until four years ago, at which time, with the help of a dietitian, he started to lose weight. However, after losing 2 kg, he discontinued the dietary regime. Two years later, when he weighed 100 kg, he decided to lose weight again because he felt uncomfortable with the way he looked and felt very overweight. Within a year, he lost 20 kg by eating less and playing basketball every day for approximately two hours a day. At that time, he had to quit basketball due to a busy school schedule which led to a fear of gaining weight, causing him to restrict his diet even more. By restricting his daily intake to 500 kcal, he had lost 17.5 kg within the last two months before presenting to our clinic. The patient denied having body image problems but agreed that he had an intense fear of gaining weight. Past medical history was unremarkable except for an appendectomy performed when he was 7 years old. The family history revealed that two of his aunts have Hashimoto thyroiditis.
At admission, the patient’s body weight was 60.7 kg (50-75th percentile). Height was 186 cm (>97th percentile) and body mass index was 17.55 kg/m2 (<3rd percentile). His body temperature was 36.1 °C and respiratory rate was 22/min. His supine blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg and heart rate was 40 bpm. His standing blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg and heart rate was 66 bpm. Cardiac examination was normal except for the bradycardia, and other systems were also normal on his physical examination. Meeting the diagnostic criteria of the fourth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV), he was diagnosed with AN-restrictive type and hospitalized due to bradycardia. His laboratory investigations which included complete blood count, liver and kidney function tests, glucose and electrolyte levels, sedimentation rate, cortisol, cholesterol levels, and urinary analysis were all within normal ranges. Thyroid function tests revealed very low TSH levels (0.025 uIU/mL, normal range: 0.27-4.20 uIU/mL), low free T3 (fT3) levels (2.87 pmol/L, normal range 3.10-6.70 pmol/L), and normal free T4 (fT4) levels (21.9 pmol/L, normal range: 12.00-22.00 pmol/L). Thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies were high, while TSH receptor antibodies were negative. With these findings, he was additionally diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Thyroid ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis.
In the inpatient unit, the patient was followed by an interdisciplinary team consisting of a child and adolescent psychiatrist, an adolescent medicine specialist, a pediatric endocrinologist, and a dietitian with special training and experience in adolescent EDs. During his three-week stay, he gained 4 kg. Despite the weight gain and the improvement in his nutritional status, bradycardia continued (40-50 bpm). Echocardiography findings were normal, and Holter monitoring only revealed sinus bradycardia. Thyroid functions were monitored closely without any medical treatment, along with his vitals. Before discharge, while TSH levels were still low (0.018 uIU/mL), fT3 levels were thought to be relatively high (3.76 pmol/L) considering his metabolic status. The patient was discharged with a weight of 64.7 kg. At his follow-up visit 2 months later, the boy had gained weight and weighed 75.1 kg. Due to the gradual increase noted in his TSH levels (from 8.91 to 28.84 uIU/mL), levothyroxine treatment was started. At that time, fT3 and fT4 levels were measured as 7.74 and 4.42 pmol/L, respectively. Two months later, it was learned that he had been using levothyroxine in doses three times higher than the recommended dose. Although monitored closely, due to the drug compliance problems and weight changes with severe body image issues, it was hard to maintain the thyroid levels within a stable course. Stabilization occurred after ten months of therapy when he started using a proper medication schedule and succeeded in preserving his target weight. The course of the thyroid function tests is given in . Bradycardia also improved with the recovery in thyroid hormone levels.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?

During preanesthetic assessment his history revealed that the he required three pillows to support his head due to the disease process and involvement of the cervical spines []. A physical examination suggested that there was severe cervical spondylitis involving thoracolumbar vertebral column, without lower limb neurological involvement. No cardiovascular system abnormality was detected.
The airway examination showed adequate mouth opening with artificial dentures, Mallampati grade III restricted neck mobility. A preoperative assessment for difficult intubation was made.
Radiographs of the vertebral column revealed ankylosis of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinous processes showing posterior joint involvement, resorption of the anterior surfaces of the vertebral bodies and calcification and ossification of the posterior ligaments and surrounding soft tissues.
Following the traditional anesthetic approach to ankylosing patients, we decided to opt for securing the airway using awake endotracheal intubation; however, the patient did not give his consent for this. A difficult intubation cart, which had a selection of oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal airway, gum elastic bougie, fiberoptic bronchoscope, cricothyroidotomy, and other aids, was kept ready.
On the day of the surgery, the patient was premedicated with oral ranitidine 150 mg and diazepam 5 mg, two hours before surgery, with a sip of water, and injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscularly one hour before surgery. Preparation for fiberoptic intubation was done. Nasal patency was checked and the nasal cavity prepared with oxymetazoline nasal drops. In the operation room the patient was made to lie supine with the head adequately supported on three pillows and routine monitors, such as, the electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure, and pulse oximeter and capnograph were placed. The IV line, with a 18 Gauge canula, was started. Anesthesia was induced with IV injection propofol 2 mg/kg, slowly, in titrated doses, with fentanyl 2 μg/kg. The anesthetist had to use a higher footstep than normal to get the desired level. We opted for fiberoptic bronchoscopy, but as the heart rate increased to 144/min and the blood pressure increased to 180/118 mmHg, we administered a further bolus dose of 50 mg of propofol to increase the depth of anesthesia. The patient's heart rate, and blood pressure stabilized, but the patient started desaturating with apneic spells, so we decided to abandon the procedure. The patient was allowed to wake up. Regional anesthesia was taken as the next option. Even after three attempts by expert hands no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained through the spinal needle.
Taylor's approach was attempted. Clear CSF was obtained through the spinal needle and 3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine and 25μg/kg fentanyl was injected intrathecally. Due to the spinal deformity, we were not able to achieve the appropriate position for intrathecal block. Therefore, we carried out some maneuvres; we placed a pillow beneath the left shoulder to make the spine of the scapula perpendicular to the table, and the operating table (OT) was tilted 20° to the right, to straighten the spine and to make it parallel to the floor.
The block was adequate with sensory block up to T4 and adequate motor blockade upto T6. The vital signs remained stable. Fluid calculations and management of blood pressure were very important in this patient with severe lung disease. Prone position had to be given carefully, with bolsters confirming to the contours of the patient, to avoid fractures.
There were no intraoperative problems throughout the procedure, which was completed within three hours. Hemostasis was adequate. Supplementary oxygen was administered continuously during the surgical procedure. There were no postoperative sequelae to the spinal technique.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?

She had initiated treatment in the outpatient clinic of her district in June 2013, attending only one visit and refusing all psychiatric treatment thereafter.
There was a family history of schizophrenia in second degree relative on her mother's side. The patient's medical history, according to her family, included recurrent acute bronchitis until 10 years of age. No history of alcohol or tobacco consumption or psychoactive substance use was reported. The patient was very selective and restrictive in her meals since her childhood. She only ate biscuits, ham croquettes, bread, and omelettes.
Regarding school, she described acceptable performance until the previous academic year when she presented some difficulties, and her teachers decided to change her to another classroom with a lower academic level.
Her premorbid personality was described as quiet and shy, with some difficulty in social relationships, but with a group of friends at the beginning of the episode. She lived with her parents and an 18-year-old sister in a mid-size city (with a population of about 216,000 inhabitants).
The patient reported that during the previous academic year she had been separated from her friends due to the change of classroom and at the same time she had begun to suffer digestive cramps and headaches, and as a result she stopped going to school. She stayed at home, with no interest in leaving the house, playing computer games and surfing the internet all day from April 2013 until her admission in our department 6 months later. The family explained that she had also become withdrawn from them, showing little interest in conversation, giving only monosyllabic answers, and gesturing in response to her parents' questions. She showed neglect in her personal hygiene and apathy regarding her physical appearance.
At the time of her admission, the mental status examination showed she was conscious and oriented in time, place, and person, though unkempt and exhibiting psychomotor retardation, poor eye contact, and limited language, answering questions with monosyllables or gestures. She also displayed emotional lability when discussing sensitive issues like friends and school and showed hypothymia, poorly reactive mood, apathy, weakness, and anhedonia and was only interested in computer usage. She did not exhibit impaired sensory perception, self-referentiality, or psychotic behavior, though she was sleeping from 4:00 am to noon. Her food intake was very selective, limited to certain specific foods, but there was no loss of appetite. The patient denied having suicidal ideation.
In the first interview, apathy and depressive moods were observed when she spoke about life events related to her friends at school and how this situation interfered with her functioning. Physical examination revealed a weight of 83.1 kg, height of 1.63 m, body mass index of 31.3, body mass index standard deviation score of 2.689, and blood pleasure of 120/80 mmHg. She denied muscular pain and no goiter or myxedema.
Soon after admission, a blood test and electrocardiogram (EKG) were performed. EKG, liver function tests, electrolytes, and whole blood count were within normal limits. Due to her isolation at home and selective food intake, levels of some vitamins were analyzed; vitamin D3 and folic acid levels were insufficient (vitamin D3: 20.9 ng/mL insufficient with levels above 30 ng/mL and folic acid: 2.3 ng/mL insufficient with levels above 3 ng/mL). The thyroid function test showed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels of 24.159 mIU/L (reference range: 0.400–4.00), free thyroxine (FT4) 0.93 ng/dL (reference range: 0.80–2.00), and triiodothyronine (T3) 1.08 ng/mL (reference range: 0.70–1.90), with antithyroid peroxidase antibodies >1300 IU/mL (reference range: <35).
We requested interconsultation with the endocrinology department where hypothyroidism secondary to Hashimoto's thyroiditis was diagnosed, and treatment with levothyroxine 50 micrograms/day was recommended. We began folic acid (5 mg/day) and vitamin D (0.266 mg/alternate days) supplementation too.
During her hospital stay, the patient adapted well to the rules of the unit, was sociable with peers, and showed no behavioural disturbances at any time.
After 8 days in our acute unit, the patient showed significant improvement in mood and social interaction and was discharged. Monitoring continued in the outpatient clinic, while the patient maintained the same pharmacological treatment. At six weeks, the patient was asymptomatic; she had returned to school showing acceptable performance and socialization with family and classmates. The new thyroid function test showed TSH 9.096 mIU/L and FT4 1.21 ng/dL. Six-months after discharge, the improvement persisted, and thyroid function was TSH 6.935 mIU/L and FT4 1.35 ng/dL and antithyroid peroxidase antibodies decreased, with 75 micrograms/day of levothyroxine.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?

The patient's height is 1.63 m, which is 1.63 m * 39.3701 in/m = 64.17326 in. 
Plugging in the values for the IBW formula for females gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (64.17326 (in inches) - 60) = 55.0985 kg.
Hence, the patient's IBW is 55.0985 kg."
170,10,Ideal Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-8045308-1,Extracted,"A 47-year-old woman presented with lower extremity weakness and paresthesia, gait disorder, and bladder and rectal disorder. Four months after the onset of numbness and motor weakness of the lower extremities, she presented to our hospital without any trauma. One week before presentation, the gait disorder and bladder and rectal disorder became apparent. The patient’s history included hypertension. There was no family history of acromegaly or OPLL.
She weighed 72 kg, her height was 162.0 cm, and her BMI was 27.4 kg/m2. Blood pressure at admission was 160/90 mmHg. Her facial appearance was acromegaly-like, with a frontal protrusion, nose and lip enlargement, and mandibular protrusion (Fig. a). We also observed thickening of the soft tissue of the palm and fingers and thickening of the Achilles tendon. There was no history of headache, sweating, or fatigue, and we did not observe Raynaud’s phenomenon or carpal tunnel syndrome.
In the upper extremities, no abnormal neurological findings were observed. However, weakness in both lower extremities (iliopsoas muscle MMT4, quadriceps femoris MMT4) was observed. Both lower extremity tendon reflexes were enhanced, and clonus was observed. Hypo-sensation (5/10) was observed below the umbilicus. These neurological findings suggested spinal cord lesions below the T10 level. She was barely able to walk on flat ground using two canes, and the Japanese Orthopedic Association score was 9 points (4–1–2-0-0-2).
The complete blood count was normal. An evaluation of glycemic status revealed a fasting plasma glucose level of 115 mg/dL. The glycosylated hemoglobin level was 5.9%, and the plasma glucose level during the OGTT (75 g glucose) at 2 h was 153 mg/dL. These results ruled out type 2 diabetes. Hepatic function tests and renal function tests revealed no abnormalities except for high alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (432 IU/L). Estimations of serum electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorous were within normal limits. Hormonal evaluation showed raised serum IGF-1 (1914 ng/mL, reference range by age for IGF-I levels is 83 ~ 221 ng/mL) and GH (80.3 ng/mL) levels. GH was not suppressed with 75 g glucose loading, (after 60 min: 131 ng/mL; after 120 min: 46.9 ng/mL).
X-ray images showed characteristic findings of acromegaly. Scalloping in some vertebrae was observed, as indicated by arrowheads on a lateral view of the lumbar X-ray in Fig. a []. On thoracic spine X-ray there were no findings of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) such as more than three successive bone bridges, and there were no anterior or posterior osteophytes with a biconcave appearance such as Erdheim spondylosis in the thoracic spine (Fig. b, c).
On computed tomography (CT) images of the whole spine, isolated OPLL was observed from the lower cervical vertebra to the middle thoracic vertebra. At T6/7, a beak-shaped protrusion into the spinal canal was observed (Figs. a, c).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole spine revealed stenosis with an intensity change in spinal cord at C6/7 and extensive spinal cord compression in the thoracic spine (Figs. b, d). Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain showed a mass without contrast enhancement on the right side of the anterior pituitary gland (size, 10 mm × 12 mm × 10 mm) with suprasellar and parasailer extension; the image revealed a pituitary macroadenoma (Fig. ).
The patient’s most remarkable symptom was paraplegia, and we diagnosed myelopathy due to thoracic OPLL. Furthermore, we suspected acromegaly because of the characteristic facial features and blood test findings (ALP 432 IU/L, GH 80.3 ng/ml, IGF-1914 ng/ml). Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain performed by the endocrinology department showed a pituitary adenoma (Fig. ). The patient’s symptoms satisfied the diagnostic criteria for acromegaly. Neurosurgery was scheduled for the pituitary adenoma, but spinal surgery was prioritized due to fear of exacerbation of neurological symptoms.
The neurological findings suggested spinal cord lesions below the T10 level, and T6/7 was judged to be the location of the primary lesion. T1–3 and T6–11 laminectomy and T1–11 posterior fixation were performed. Additionally, there was severe spinal cord compression in C6/7, and open-door laminoplasty with a lamina plate was performed for C5–7 (Fig. ).
On the third day after the operation, rehabilitation was started with a cervical collar and hard thoracolumbar corset. The postoperative course was good, the paralysis gradually improved, and the patient was able to walk alone indoors. She was discharged 3 weeks after the operation. There have been no adverse or unanticipated events. Two months after the spinal surgery, resection of the pituitary adenoma was performed in the neurosurgery department, and the patient is still under observation. A pathological image (H&E, × 400) is provided and showed a sheet of monotonous cells with round nuclei and loss of normal lobular patterns of the pituitary adenoma (Fig. ). Staining for TSH and ACTH was negative. Staining for PRL was positive in 10% of the resected pituitary tissue. Staining for CAM5.2 was diffusely positive in many cells and several cells had fibrous bodies. These findings are consistent with growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas. We did not have other antibodies, so it was difficult to classify the pituitary adenoma in detail.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?

He had a good performance status (grade 0). Laboratory tests showed serum albumin level of 5.3 g/dL, bilirubin level of 1.3 mg/dL, and prothrombin time international normalized ratio of 1.1. Neither ascites nor hepatic encephalopathy was found, which corresponded with Child-Pugh class A. Serologic markers for hepatitis B and C were negative. Serum α-fetoprotein level was 311.7 ng/mL, and PIVKA-II level was over 2,000 mAU/mL. Other laboratory findings including tumor markers and thyroid function tests were within normal limits. About a 5 cm sized ovoid enhancing mass in arterial phase involving the caudate lobe with underlying cirrhotic configuration of the liver was shown on the dynamic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (, respectively). There was no vascular invasion and no intraabdominal lymphadenopathy. On positron emission tomography-CT, maximum standardized uptake value for the mass was 6.3 without evidence of distant metastasis. Overall, early stage of HCC was assigned according to the Barcelona-Clinic-Liver-Cancer (BCLC) HCC staging system.
Surgical resection was recommended for the treatment of the HCC, however, he refused the surgical treatment. TACE using DEB was performed after obtaining written informed consent for the procedure. During the first TACE session, hepatic angiogram revealed a definite hypervascular mass supplied by a small branch of the left hepatic artery without apparent arteriovenous shunt (). After positioning the microcatheter tip at the left hepatic artery close to the tumor-feeding branch, a mixture of DEB (DC Bead®, 1 vial of 300~500 µm diameter, Biocompatibles, UK) loaded with doxorubicin (50 mg) and contrast agent was infused until the flow through the tumor-feeding artery was slowed down. After the infusion, angiogram showed occluded tumor-feeding branch and no tumor staining ().
He had no serious adverse event after embolization except mild abdominal pain that was controlled with oral analgesic (tramadol 50 mg per os tid). One-month post-embolization CT () and six-month post-embolization MRI () showed complete necrosis without viable portions.

He had a past medical history of esophageal varices rupture 20 years before. Since then, he had visited our hospital for alcoholic liver cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus. He received a treatment for ascites caused by liver cirrhosis. Urinary diuresis was not effective because of low Na level and dehydration. As liver function was relatively suppressed, he underwent Denver shunt implantation 9 months before presentation. After the operation of Denver shunt implantation, ascites rapidly disappeared. Diabetes mellitus was controlled well (HbA1c 6.3%) by a oral hypoglycemic agent (glimepiride 3 mg/day).
This time, he developed high-grade fever with chills and without gastrointestinal symptoms. His body temperature was 38.5°C, but he was hemodynamically stable with normal mental status. Initial laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell count 7,700/μl, hemoglobin 12.9 g/dl, platelets 5.6 × 104/μl PT-INR 1.43, CRP 5.0 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 349 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 353 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 522 IU/l, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 104 IU/l, total bilirubin (T-bil) 4.3 mg/dl and albumin 4.1 g/dl. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) showed multiple small low-echoic lesions in the right lobe of the liver (fig. ). These findings were further confirmed by abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) that showed peripheral enhancement with central hypodense multiple small lesions in the right lobe of the liver with no ascites (fig. ). After admission to our hospital, he underwent echocardiography, chest CT, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy, however, no other sources of infection could be detected. Blood culture was negative and anti-amebic antibody was also negative. He was treated for pyogenic liver abscesses with sulbactam/cefoperazone for 2 weeks and subsequently changed to levofloxacin for 2 months. The liver abscesses disappeared after the antibiotic treatment and liver function normalized to original levels (AST 44 IU/l, ALT 37 IU/l, ALP 336 IU/l, GGT 85 IU/l and T-bil 0.9 mg/dl). However, 3 months later, he suffered from high-grade fever with chills and no other symptoms. Laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell count 7,400/μl, platelets 4.6 × 104/μl, CRP 9.2 mg/dl, AST 933 IU/l, ALT 1,202 IU/l, ALP 870 IU/l, GGT 93 IU/l and T-bil 4.0 mg/dl. Abdominal enhanced CT showed multiple small lesions in both lobes of the liver (fig. 2). Blood culture was negative. Sulbactam/cefoperazone had no effects. Meropenem was administered for 2 weeks, followed by levofloxacin for 2 months, and liver function rapidly normalized to original levels (AST 43 IU/l, ALT 30 IU/l, ALP 435 IU/l, GGT 87 IU/l and T-bil 1.8 mg/dl). After the levofloxacin treatment, the disappearance of liver abscess was confirmed (fig. ). We started selective intestinal decontamination by administering kanamycin (2 g/day) to prevent the occurrence of abdominal infection. Since then, he has had no recurrence of liver abscess for over a year.

The patient's INR is 1.43. Because the INR is less than 1.7, we add 1 to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The concentration of bilirubin is 4.3 mg/dL. Because the bilirubin concentration is greater than 3 mg/dL, we add 3 to the score, making the current total 1 + 3 = 4.
The concentration of albumin is 4.1 g/dL. Because the albumin concentration is greater than 3.5 g/dL, we add 1 point to the score, making the current total 4 + 1 = 5.
The patient's ascites state is determined to be 'absent' and so we add 1 point to the score, making the current total 5 + 1 = 6.
The patient is determined to not have any encephalopathy and so we add one point to the score, making the current total 6 + 1 = 7.

209,15,Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality,severity,integer,pmc-4236611-1,Extracted,"A 41-year-old man was initially evaluated in the emergency department for a 2-month history of shortness of breath, abdominal distension, scrotal swelling, and left inguinal pain. Past history included long-term use of intravenous drugs, extensive and current alcohol use with evidence of cirrhosis based on laboratory findings, and imaging and seropositivity for hepatitis C antibody without measurable viremia. He also had a history of sustaining an upper abdominal stab wound requiring exploratory laparotomy in the early 1990s. He denied fevers, rigors, night sweats, weight loss, or skin rashes.
Initial evaluation revealed an ill appearing man with tachycardia (heart rate 120 beats/min) with mild hypotension (blood pressure 85–105/50–60 mmHg), and tachypnea (respiratory rate 20–25/min) requiring 2 L/min supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain a blood oxygen saturation >95 %. He had distant heart sounds with tachycardia and regular rhythm without murmurs or gallops. He had jugular venous distension with a positive Kussmaul’s sign and pulsus paradoxus. There was significant abdominal distention present with a fluid wave. He had stigmata of chronic liver disease with spider angiomata noted and collateral venous distension in the abdominal wall. Furthermore, he had scrotal swelling and bilateral lower extremity edema. He was admitted to the hospital’s Medicine Service.
On admission, a chest radiograph revealed enlargement of the cardiac silhouette (Fig. ). A bedside echocardiogram illustrated a large pericardial effusion with evidence of hemodynamic compromise, including right atrial and right ventricular diastolic collapse, a >30 % respiratory variability in the tricuspid and mitral valve flow rates, and a swinging cardiac motion consistent with the presence of cardiac tamponade demanding urgent intervention.
Admission laboratory values revealed a normal white blood cell count, a mild macrocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume 95 fL) with a hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, a hematocrit of 36 %, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 84,000/μL. Tests of liver function revealed serum concentrations of albumin of 2.2 g/dL (N > 3.5 g/dL), total bilirubin of 3.1 mg/dL, with direct bilirubin of 1.9 mg/dL, an aspartate aminotransferase of 83 U/mL, an alanine aminotransferase of 37 U/mL, an alkaline phosphatase of 106 U/mL (upper limits of normal 150 U/mL), and a γ-glutamyl transpeptidase of 48 U/mL (upper limits of normal <98 U/L). Studies of coagulation revealed an elevated prothrombin time (PT) of 21 s and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.87. Abdominal paracentesis revealed a serum albumin-to-ascites gradient (SAAG) >1.1 g/dL, and a total protein concentration of <2.5 g/dL, consistent with portal hypertension: The total white blood cell count was 220/mm3, with 22 % neutrophils. These results were compatible with the diagnosis of an uninfected ascites due to portal hypertension as a probable consequence of his cirrhosis. The initial chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly, bilateral pulmonary edema, and minimal pleural effusions (Fig. ). Ultrasound scan of the right upper quadrant revealed a nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension such as mild splenomegaly and large volume ascites with no space-occupying lesion was identified. Admission pericardiocentesis had an opening pressure of 20 mmHg and, after removal of 1.5 L of serous pericardial fluid and placement of a drain, a closing pressure of 9 mmHg. Pericardial fluid analysis revealed protein concentrations and other characteristics identical to those found in the ascitic fluid: All pericardial cultures were negative, and no organisms were seen. Otherwise, the echocardiogram was relatively normal, as was cardiac function. Over the succeeding 24 h, 3 L of fluid drained from the pericardial sac, as did an additional 3 L during the subsequent 24-h period. It was suspected that ascitic fluid was exiting through the pericardial drain.
During investigation, a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 28 mm/h and serum concentrations of C-reactive protein of 1.1 mg/dL, creatine phosphokinase of 101 U/L, aldolase of 6.1 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase of 398 U/L were all noted. Serum lipids and triglycerides were unremarkable. Investigation for the etiology of chronic liver disease revealed a serum ferritin of 113 ng/mL, negative anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies, and negative virologic evidence for hepatitis A or B. Hepatitis C Ab was positive, but serum hepatitis C virus was undetectable. Serum α-1 anti-trypsin and ceruloplasmin, serum copper, and TSH concentrations were normal. Serological investigations for a possible rheumatological disease were unremarkable as well as infectious evaluation for HIV, Lyme disease, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A PET/CT scan revealed no FDG-avid focus in any area.
Since decreased pericardial fluid volume was noted on the fourth and fifth hospital days, the pericardial drain was removed. Two days later, he became progressively dyspneic with repeat chest X-ray showing bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly, and diffuses pulmonary edema.
A radionuclide SPECT scan was then performed following injection of 5.11 mCi 99mTechnetium-labeled, macroaggregated albumin (MAA) into the peritoneal cavity. There was essentially no delay between the infusion of 99mTc-MAA and imaging. Although dynamic imaging was performed, the uptake in the pericardial sac was only faint at 15 min, but clearly visible at 1 h. The most impressive images were obtained at 4–24 h (Fig. ), where there was circumferential pericardial radiotracer distribution.",What is the patient's Child-Pugh Score?

He denied any chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, fever, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response rate of 173. On physical examination, he was alert but anxious with an irregular heart rate. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. He developed subsequent diltiazem-induced hypotension and resultant global ischemic organ injury requiring cardioversion, intubation, and vasopressor support. Laboratory studies at the time of presentation were significant for sodium of 130 mmol/L, potassium of 4.6 mmol/L, creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL, albumin of 2.4 g/dL, AST of 10,050 U/L, ALT of 3.056 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 119 U/L, and total bilirubin of 3.6 mg/dL. His complete blood count was significant for hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, MCV of 97.1 fl, platelet count of 148 × 109/L, and WBC of 18.3/μl. He was also noted to be coagulopathic with an INR of 2.2. A CT scan of the thorax was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, and this showed an incidental liver lesion measuring 2 × 2 cm with residual contrast in the noncontrast series and was read as a hemangioma (Fig. ). He presented to the emergency department 9 months later with syncopal episodes. CT angiography showed no signs of pulmonary embolism, but an enlarging liver lesion with intralesional calcifications measuring 4.3 × 3.9 cm with borderline enlarged lymph nodes in the porta hepatis (Fig. ). He was referred to our hepatobiliary neoplasia clinic for further management. An ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy of the lesion was obtained (Fig. ).
The liver biopsy showed a neoplasm with epithelioid and spindle cell features, prominent nucleoli, occasional intranuclear pseudoinclusions, and frequent mitotic activity. Immunostains showed the tumor cells to be positive for S100, Melan-A, and SOX10, but negative for keratins (AE1/AE3, Oscar), desmin, CD34, and arginase, consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed to exclude other primitive malignant cancers. Complete skin and eye examination in addition to further imaging studies did not identify the primary site.

215,15,Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality,severity,integer,pmc-3177917-1,Extracted,"A 33-year-old Turkish man was admitted to our emergency department with complaints of nausea, vomiting, weakness, diarrhea, and fever up to 38.8°C which had lasted for one month. The patient, who had been diagnosed with FMF at 17 years of age, had been started on a regular hemodialysis program at 29 years of age upon the development of chronic renal failure due to amyloidosis. He was not taking any pills regularly except colchicine tablets.
At his physical examination, his general appearance was apathic and cachectic, his mucous membranes were dry and pale, and his skin was dry and rough with a urochromic color. His blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, and his heart rate was 81 beats/minute. His heartbeat was rhythmic with auscultation, and there was no additional sound murmur. His abdominal examination showed that his liver extended 5 cm below the costal margin. The hepatic surface was rough and even and was painless on palpation. Traube's space was closed, and the spleen extended 2 cm below the costal margin. His muscles were atrophied at the extremities, and he had shedding hairs and an arteriovenous fistula on the left arm. No other pathological findings were detected during his systemic examinations.
At the time of his first admission to the hospital, his laboratory tests with abnormal values were hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, hematocrit 26.9%, mean corpuscular volume 79fL, bilirubin 1.6 mg/dL, creatinine 8.3 mg/dL, urea 60 mg/dL, albumin 2.1 g/dL, sodium 132 mmol/L, International Normalized Ratio 1.30, and prothrombin time 15.6 seconds. Hemoculture, stool microscopy, and stool culture were carried out after we observed recurring high fever attacks during his regular hemodialysis sessions, but he did not have high fever at his follow-up examinations. When no pathogenic microorganisms were detected, intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g twice daily was started empirically. Doppler ultrasonography and echocardiography were performed to identify fistulas, but there was still no obvious explanation for his fever. Abdominal US showed small fluid collections around the liver edge.
After a fever that persisted for more than five days, the patient was started on 1 g of intravenous vancomycin once every four days. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed, and hepatosplenomegaly was detected. The liver edge was regular with hepatic parenchyma and showed no pathological finding. His ductus choledochus (common bile duct), intra-hepatic bile ducts, and gallbladder were all normal. Minimal ascites was detected in the abdomen. Examination of the ascites puncture sample produced no findings in favor of tuberculosis. The patient was scheduled for gastroscopy and colonoscopy but had hypoglycemic attacks during the preparation phase. His esophagogastroscopic examination results were within normal ranges. Examination of rectal biopsy samples taken during colonoscopy revealed type AA amyloidosis.
The patient's fever was closely monitored for hypoglycemic episodes and decreased as a result of two weeks of antibiotic therapy. His ocular fundus examination and cranial MRI scans were normal, but he kept on vomiting frequently. During an attack of hypoglycemia, his laboratory results were blood glucose 36 mg/dL, insulin 0.2 μU/mL, C peptide 1.4 ng/mL, sodium 127 mmol/L, and cortisol 7.68 mcg/dL. A Synacthen stimulation test was planned with consultation by an endocrinologist to investigate for adrenal insufficiency. The maximum cortisol value measured was 8.87 μg/dL, and the patient was diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency, so he was started on prednisolone 40 mg per day administered intramuscularly. Subsequently, prednisolone tablets 10 mg/day were started. The patient's diarrhea came to an end, and his hypoglycemia did not recur. The patient's complaints of fatigue and loss of appetite decreased. He was discharged from the hospital with scheduled out-patient clinic monitoring. Three months later he died in the emergency department as a result of cardiac arrest caused by hypokalemia.",What is the patient's Child-Pugh Score?

236,16,Wells' Criteria for DVT,risk,decimal,15,Synthetic,"A 47-year-old man with a history limited to well-controlled mild asthma and seasonal rhinitis presented to the ambulatory triage area mid-morning complaining of an aching sensation and progressive enlargement of his right calf that began roughly thirty-hours prior while he was at work installing cabinetry in a two-story townhome. He recalls kneeling frequently and carrying heavy toolboxes up a flight of stairs but denies any single twisting injury, audible pop, or sharp pain; instead, he noticed a vague tightness behind the knee late that evening which intensified overnight, prompting him to inspect both lower limbs side-by-side in the bathroom mirror. The following morning his work sock left a noticeable indentation at the upper ankle and the posterior calf looked fuller than its counterpart, so he measured the circumference with a flexible sewing tape he keeps for home projects: at a point exactly 10 cm distal to the tibial tuberosity the right leg measured 41 cm whereas the left measured 37 cm, a disparity of 4 cm that persisted when rechecked two hours later before clinic arrival. He reports no comparable swelling of the thigh, knee, or foot, no discoloration, and no warmth appreciable through his trouser leg. He has not been bedridden—he walks his dog twice daily, drove himself to the clinic, and continues normal activities except for avoiding squats because they provoke discomfort. He has not undergone surgery, endoscopy, or invasive dental work in the past year, and the most recent hospitalization was an overnight observation for an asthma exacerbation four years ago. He has never received chemotherapy, has no known malignancy, and has not required a cast, splint, or immobilizing boot. He flew to Denver on a two-hour flight last week but sat in an aisle seat and walked the terminal without prolonged stasis. He denies fever, chills, sweats, rash, trauma, insect bite, recent soft-tissue infection, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, hemoptysis, or syncope. Medications include inhaled budesonide-formoterol twice daily and an albuterol rescue inhaler used perhaps once a month; he takes no hormonal preparations, anticoagulants, or herbal supplements. He never smokes, drinks two beers on weekends, and does not use illicit drugs. There is no family history of thromboembolic disease or hypercoagulable states. On examination he appears fit, ambulating with a slight antalgic gait favoring the right side but otherwise in no distress. Vital signs: temperature 98.4 °F (36.9 °C), pulse 88 beats/min regular, blood pressure 128/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 14/min, and oxygen saturation 98 % on ambient air. Cardiac auscultation reveals a normal S1/S2 without murmurs; lungs are clear with no wheezes; jugular venous pressure is not elevated. Abdomen is soft and nontender. Inspection of the lower extremities shows asymmetric fullness confined to the mid-calf region of the right leg with a subtle glossy sheen of overlying skin; the right ankle and foot appear normal in size, and thigh girth measured 15 cm proximal to the patella is symmetric at 50 cm bilaterally. Gentle finger pressure over the anterior tibia of the right calf produces a 2-mm pit that rebounds within 15 seconds, whereas no indentation forms on the left. The right calf feels slightly warmer but not erythematous. Palpation along the course of the popliteal and posterior tibial venous channels elicits focal tenderness deep to the medial gastrocnemius; squeezing the muscle belly itself produces only diffuse soreness. There is no palpable cord, no varicosities, and no cyanosis of the toes. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are 2+ and equal; capillary refill is less than two seconds. Range of motion at the knee and ankle is full; dorsiflexion of the ankle with knee extended reproduces a pulling discomfort but no lancinating pain. Neurologic examination shows intact sensation and 5/5 motor strength. No inguinal lymphadenopathy is present. Bedside urine dip is unremarkable. Baseline laboratory tests obtained before any anticoagulant therapy demonstrate hemoglobin 15.0 g/dL, platelet count 242 × 10⁹/L, white blood cell count 7.1 × 10⁹/L, serum creatinine 0.92 mg/dL, sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.0 mmol/L, AST/ALT within normal limits, prothrombin time 12.1 seconds with an INR of 1.0, and aPTT 29 seconds. An electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm. Clinically, the unilateral calf enlargement greater than 3 cm, discrete pitting edema confined to the symptomatic limb, and pinpoint tenderness tracking the deep venous pathway raise strong concern for an obstructive process within the deep veins of the right calf; musculoskeletal strain or ruptured popliteal cyst remain possibilities but appear less compelling given the objective girth discrepancy and focal venous tenderness. Duplex ultrasonography of the entire right lower extremity has been ordered on an urgent basis, and the patient has been instructed to limit strenuous activity and to alert staff immediately should he notice sudden chest discomfort or worsening shortness of breath while awaiting imaging.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis?

230,16,Wells' Criteria for DVT,risk,decimal,10,Synthetic,"A 49-year-old woman came to the urgent care area of the medical ward late this morning because of new-onset pain and fullness in her right upper calf that started while she was grocery shopping yesterday afternoon. She describes the discomfort as a deep, pressure-like ache that intensifies when she flexes the knee or when the examiner presses along the line from the medial calf toward the popliteal fossa; she can localize it with one finger and says it is clearly worse when weight-bearing. She denies redness, warmth, itching, fever, chills, or recent skin trauma. She had been back at work as a high-school principal for the last three weeks after undergoing an open sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis for complicated diverticulitis exactly six weeks ago; the postoperative course was uneventful, she was walking the hallways on postoperative day one, and she never required prolonged bed rest at home. Her medical history is notable for a documented iliofemoral venous thrombosis on the opposite side five years earlier that was confirmed by duplex ultrasound and treated with a six-month course of warfarin until complete recanalization was demonstrated. She has no history of malignancy, chronic neurologic deficits, lower-limb casting, pelvic fractures, or recent air travel, and she has remained physically active, walking two miles most evenings with her spouse. Medications include a daily multivitamin, rosuvastatin 10 mg, and ibuprofen as needed for postoperative abdominal wall soreness; she is not taking estrogen-containing therapy, glucocorticoids, or anticoagulants. She quit smoking 10 years ago after a 12-pack-year history and drinks wine on weekends; there is no family history of inherited clotting disorders, premature myocardial infarction, or malignancy. Review of systems is otherwise negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, hemoptysis, abdominal pain, or unexplained weight loss. On arrival her vital signs were temperature 37.0 °C, blood pressure 124/76 mm Hg, heart rate 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99 % breathing room air. She appeared well and was able to stand on the examination stool without assistance. Cardiac auscultation revealed a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs; lungs were clear to bases without crackles. The abdominal incision was healed with no tenderness or mass. Examination of the lower limbs showed the right calf to be slightly fuller to the eye but without taut skin or discoloration; when measured 10 cm below the tibial tuberosity the circumference was 38.5 cm versus 37.2 cm on the left, a discrepancy she said she had not noticed before. Gentle compression over the course of the posterior tibial and popliteal veins elicited focal tenderness, whereas squeezing the gastrocnemius muscle belly away from those structures was much less uncomfortable. The overlying skin was warm but dry, and no indentation was produced after five seconds of firm thumb pressure over the tibia. A network of bluish, non-tortuous superficial channels was visibly prominent along the medial aspect of the calf and became more obvious when the leg was placed in a dependent position for several seconds. There were no spider angiomas, no stasis dermatitis, and no varicosities elsewhere. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were 2+ bilaterally and symmetric; capillary refill was brisk, and sensorimotor testing of both lower extremities was normal. There was no inguinal lymphadenopathy, hip tenderness, or back pain. Point-of-care laboratory testing obtained prior to any treatment showed hemoglobin 13.4 g/dL, platelet count 212 × 10⁹/L, serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, and INR 1.0. Electrocardiogram displayed normal sinus rhythm without acute changes. No obvious musculoskeletal or infectious etiology was identified on history or examination, and the examiner judged that other causes of unilateral calf pain—such as cellulitis, muscular strain, Baker cyst rupture, or arterial insufficiency—were less consistent with the physical findings than an occlusion in the deep venous system. She was counseled about signs of pulmonary embolism and remained in the department awaiting formal duplex ultrasonography to confirm the suspected diagnosis.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis?

235,16,Wells' Criteria for DVT,risk,decimal,14,Synthetic,"A 38-year-old postpartum woman arrived to the ambulatory triage area late this afternoon because her left lower leg had become noticeably heavier and mildly painful over the preceding 24 hours. Six weeks ago she delivered her second child via uncomplicated scheduled cesarean section that required spinal anesthesia and an overnight stay; she was discharged on postoperative day 2 and has since resumed routine household activities without assistive devices. Yesterday morning, while standing at the kitchen counter for an extended period preparing bottles, she felt a dull pressure deep in the posterior aspect of the calf that worsened when she bore weight and eased modestly with elevation. By evening she observed that her sock left an imprint on that side but not on the right. She denies antecedent trauma, ankle sprain, insect bite, recent intense exercise, or local skin infection. She also denies fevers, chills, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, or constitutional complaints. There is no history of malignant disease, hematologic disorder, or prior venous clot, nor has she ever required anticoagulation. She reports no neurologic illness, limb weakness, or application of a plaster cast, and she has remained fully mobile caring for her newborn. She uses no estrogen-containing contraception and takes only prenatal vitamins and 600 mg ibuprofen as needed for incisional soreness. Both parents are alive and free of venous thromboembolic events; no siblings have clotting disorders. She has never smoked, drinks wine rarely, and denies illicit drug use. On presentation she appeared comfortable holding the infant carrier, spoke in complete sentences, and ambulated without assistance. Vital signs before any medications were temperature 37.0 °C, blood pressure 118/72 mm Hg, heart rate 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99 % on ambient air. Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rhythm with no murmurs; lungs were clear to auscultation. Abdominal inspection showed a well-healed Pfannenstiel scar that was nontender with no palpable masses or organomegaly. Inspection of the lower extremities demonstrated subtle fullness confined to the left calf; there was no erythema, hyperpigmentation, varicosity, or brawny skin change. A flexible tape placed 10 cm below the tibial tuberosity measured 38.0 cm on the left and 36.4 cm on the right, a disparity of 1.6 cm. Circumference at mid-thigh and around the ankle was symmetric. Gentle thumb pressure over the anterior tibia and dorsum of the left foot produced a 1+ indentation that resolved within 15 seconds, whereas identical pressure on the right left no depression. Palpation along the course of the popliteal vein and posteromedial calf elicited focal discomfort described by the patient as “a deep bruise,” compared with no tenderness over the contralateral limb; squeezing the gastrocnemius muscle belly away from the neurovascular bundle produced only minimal diffuse soreness. There was no palpable subcutaneous cord and no crepitus. Passive dorsiflexion of the ankle did not reproduce pain at the Achilles insertion. Skin temperature was marginally warmer over the symptomatic calf compared with the right when assessed with the dorsum of the examiner’s hand. Distal pulses—dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial—were 2+ bilaterally, and capillary refill of all toes was under two seconds. Motor strength in ankle dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, and great-toe extension was 5/5, and sensation to light touch and vibration was intact. Straight-leg raise and seated slump test were negative for radicular symptoms, making a spinal etiology improbable. There was no ipsilateral knee effusion, meniscal tenderness, or ligamentous laxity, and range of motion at the hip, knee, and ankle was full. No inguinal lymphadenopathy was appreciated. Basic laboratory studies obtained prior to any antithrombotic therapy showed hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL, platelet count 248 × 10⁹/L, white blood cells 7.1 × 10⁹/L, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, and an INR of 1.0 with activated partial thromboplastin time 29 seconds. These values reveal no anemia, thrombocytopenia, or renal impairment that might confound subsequent management. Given the recent abdominal-pelvic surgical intervention within the past two months, the presence of unilateral pitting edema confined to the calf, focal tenderness along the deep venous pathway, and the absence of a compelling musculoskeletal, dermatologic, or neurologic explanation, an acute thrombotic obstruction of the deep venous system remains the leading consideration at this stage of evaluation.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis?

227,16,Wells' Criteria for DVT,risk,decimal,7,Synthetic,"A 55-year-old woman presented to the urgent care area of the medical ward late this morning with a chief complaint of progressive swelling of her right lower extremity that she first noted two days ago while getting dressed for work. She reports that on awakening that morning her shoe felt tight and the pant leg seemed snug from ankle to hip; by last night the limb had become visibly larger than the left with a heavy, taut sensation and mild aching that worsened during her usual 20-minute walk home but abated somewhat after she elevated the leg on a pillow. She denies fevers, night sweats, chills, trauma, insect bites, rashes, or new medications. She has not experienced chest pain, hemoptysis, pleuritic pain, palpitations, or light-headedness. Her surgical history is notable for a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy performed six weeks ago at an outside facility; she recovered well, returned to office work after ten days, and has been able to ambulate freely without any prolonged periods of recumbency, long-distance travel, air flights, or car rides exceeding one hour. Her past medical history includes class II obesity prior to surgery, well-controlled hypothyroidism on levothyroxine 75 µg daily, and seasonal allergic rhinitis for which she takes cetirizine as needed. She has never been treated for thromboembolic disease, nor has she undergone vein ablation, sclerotherapy, or vascular bypass. She does not smoke, drinks wine socially, and denies hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptive use since menopause three years ago. Family history is negative for thrombophilia, premature myocardial infarction, or stroke; both parents are alive in their eighties. Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable. On arrival, vital signs were temperature 36.8 °C, blood pressure 126/76 mm Hg, heart rate 92 beats/min, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 97 % on ambient air. She appeared mildly uncomfortable but was able to ambulate to the examination table without assistance. Cardiac examination revealed a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with good air entry. The abdomen was soft and nontender with well-healed trocar scars in the epigastrium and left upper quadrant, no palpable masses, and active bowel sounds. Lower-extremity inspection demonstrated obvious enlargement of the entire right leg from groin to ankle with a subtle glossy sheen of the skin but no erythema, warmth, ulceration, or weeping. A flexible tape measure placed 10 cm below the tibial tuberosity recorded a circumference of 39 cm on the right versus 37 cm on the left, confirming only a 2 cm difference at the calf. Measurement 15 cm above the patella revealed 55 cm on the right compared with 50 cm on the left, highlighting more pronounced proximal fullness. Soft-tissue compression over the anterior tibia produced a 2-mm depression that refilled within 20 seconds, and similar pitting was reproducible over the dorsum of the right foot; no such indentation occurred on the contralateral side. Distal pulses (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial) were palpable and symmetric, capillary refill was brisk, and skin temperature was comparable in both limbs. Sensation to light touch, proprioception, and vibration was intact, and motor strength was 5/5 throughout. There was no calf cord, no palpable popliteal mass, and no discoloration of the toes. Examination of joints revealed full, pain-free range of motion at the knee, ankle, and hip without effusion or crepitus. No enlargement of inguinal lymph nodes was noted. Laboratory studies obtained before any anticoagulant therapy showed hemoglobin 13.4 g/dL, platelet count 254 × 10⁹/L, leukocytes 6.8 × 10⁹/L, sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.1 mmol/L, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, and normal transaminases; prothrombin time was 12.4 seconds with an INR of 1.0, and aPTT was 30 seconds. A serum β-hCG test was negative. Given the recent abdominal surgery within the past two months, unilateral swelling involving the full length of the limb, confined pitting edema, absence of prolonged bed rest, lack of prior thrombotic episodes, and no obvious alternative source such as cellulitis, lymphedema, orthopedic injury, or heart failure, an acute obstructive process in the deep venous system of the right lower extremity is considered high on the differential, and a duplex ultrasound encompassing the iliac, femoral, popliteal, and calf veins has been urgently ordered.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis?

231,16,Wells' Criteria for DVT,risk,decimal,11,Extracted,"A 39-year-old male with a five-year history of moderate ulcerative colitis (UC), as per Montreal classification, was admitted to the emergency department with worsening abdominal and rectal pain secondary to a C. diff infection of one week. Patient had a multi-week history of diarrhea that was waking him up at night leading up to the C. diff diagnosis. One week prior to ED admission, his GI had ordered precautionary leukocytes and C. diff due to history of UC, and both returned positive. Per GI note, ""Vancomycin prescribed as this patient has IBD and patients with IBD can develop spontaneous C. diff infections and need to be treated regardless of toxin presence."" He had no prior history of antibiotic use over the past three months or triggering factor for C. diff infection.
Over the course of the week, his symptoms progressed, and he claimed to have nausea, vomiting, and hematochezia.
The patient presented with a past medical history of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obstructive sleep apnea. His allergies included trazodone and amoxicillin/clavulanate. His family history was unrevealing. His surgical history included cholecystectomy and thyroglossal duct cyst removal in 2019.
This patient was a nonsmoker. He denied alcohol or drug use. He tried to maintain a healthy diet of lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables.
Initial vitals on presentation included: temperature: 98.6 F, pulse: 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute, pulse oximetry: 95%, blood pressure: 119/87 mmHg, weight: 217.16 lbs, and body mass index: 32.14.
General surgery was consulted upon CT scan with IV contrast revealing new extraluminal gas in the perineum surrounding the anus and distal rectum (Figures , , , ). He was examined and subsequently diagnosed with rectal perforation.
Preoperatively, the patient’s physical exam revealed an uncomfortable looking young man in mild distress due to abdominal pain. An abdominal exam revealed no distention, masses, rebound, or guarding. The absence of McBurney’s sign, Murphy’s sign, and peritoneal inflammation was noted. There was no active rectal bleeding at the time of physical examination. Laboratory data revealed an elevated c-reactive protein of 66.4. Complete blood count and complete metabolic panel were otherwise within normal limits. Despite infection and imaging reflecting perforation, white blood count was found to be 5.9 k/cmm.
After review of the available data, assessment of clinical condition, and deliberation with the emergency department physicians and the patient’s primary gastroenterology physician, the surgery team decided the patient would require an urgent exploratory laparotomy with total abdominal colectomy and end ileostomy due to the diagnosis of rectal perforation secondary to C. diff colitis on chronic UC.
The patient was immediately brought to the operating room. The primary incision was made from the subxiphoid to the pubic symphysis within two hours of initial presentation to the hospital. The colon was visualized and resected; thus, a total colectomy was undergone. The pre-rectal space was opened to identify signs of purulence or injury, which found crepitus and severe UC causing circumferential ulcerations and a deep ulcer in the midline anteriorly. These ulcers traversed all layers of the rectal wall. A drain was placed to drain potential abscess or infection from the pre-rectal space.
The patient left the OR in stable condition after enduring no complications intraoperatively. He remained in the inpatient surgical unit for five days, during which he continued to advance his diet and ambulate successfully. He was discharged after an education session on ostomy bag maintenance and told to follow up with the general surgery team and gastroenterology team in one week. At his one-week follow-up post-op visit, the patient was doing well, ostomy output was draining appropriately, and he denied fever, nausea, or vomiting. No secondary follow-up surgery was required.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis?

248,17,Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk,risk,integer,3,Synthetic,"A 67-year-old woman presented to the pre-operative assessment clinic the afternoon before a scheduled open repair of a 6.1 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, an operation classified by the surgical team as a major vascular intervention given the anticipated cross-clamp time and retroperitoneal exposure. She was referred for medical clearance by her vascular surgeon after routine laboratory studies and chart review raised concern for possible peri-operative cardiac and renal risk. The patient ambulated into the office without dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal breathing disturbance, or peripheral edema, and she denied any history of nocturnal cough, frothy sputum, weight gain from fluid, or lower-extremity swelling. Her exercise tolerance was described as walking six city blocks at a moderate pace and climbing a single flight of household stairs while carrying groceries, limited more by occasional lumbar discomfort than by chest pressure or shortness of breath. She explicitly denied prior episodes of angina, myocardial infarction, coronary stenting, coronary artery bypass, or positive stress imaging. Review of vascular history, however, was notable for a lacunar infarct in the left corona radiata 4 years earlier, which had manifested with transient right-arm numbness and dysarthria that resolved fully within 48 hours following intravenous thrombolysis. Subsequent neurologic follow-up confirmed no residual weakness or speech deficit, and she remains on daily aspirin and a high-intensity statin for secondary prevention; she reports strict adherence and no bleeding complications. Her other chronic illnesses include well-controlled essential hypertension managed with losartan 100 mg each morning, stage 3 chronic kidney disease attributed to hypertensive nephrosclerosis with baseline creatinine values fluctuating between 1.8 and 2.1 mg/dL, and mixed dyslipidemia. She has never been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and therefore has never required insulin or other glucose-lowering agents; her most recent fasting plasma glucose six months ago was 93 mg/dL and hemoglobin A1c was 5.6%. There is no personal or family history of congestive cardiomyopathy, rheumatic valvular disease, or congenital heart anomalies. She quit smoking 12 years ago after a 30-pack-year career and denies alcohol use or illicit substances. Medications taken on the morning of evaluation include losartan, amlodipine 5 mg, aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg nightly, and cholecalciferol. On physical examination in the pre-operative suite she appeared comfortable and conversant, blood pressure was 138/72 mm Hg in the right arm seated, heart rate 74 beats per minute and regular, respiratory rate 14, oxygen saturation 98% on ambient air, oral temperature 36.8 °C, and body mass index 28.4 kg/m². Jugular venous pulsation was not elevated, carotid upstrokes were brisk without bruit, and auscultation revealed a normal S1 and S2 with no gallops, murmurs, or rubs. Lungs were clear to the bases, abdomen soft with a palpable pulsatile mass consistent with the known aneurysm but no tenderness, and peripheral pulses were 2+ bilaterally with warm extremities and intact neurologic function. Pre-operative laboratory panel drawn two hours earlier showed stable anemia with hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, platelets 235 ×10⁹/L, sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.3 mmol/L, bicarbonate 23 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 41 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 2.3 mg/dL, representing a slight rise from her last nephrology clinic visit but without accompanying oliguria or uremic symptoms. Electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria, and no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. A transthoracic echocardiogram from eight months prior documented normal left ventricular size, concentric hypertrophy, and an ejection fraction of 60% without regional wall motion abnormality, valvular stenosis, or regurgitation. The patient expresses understanding of the need for the upcoming complex intra-abdominal operation to prevent aneurysmal rupture and is eager to proceed, requesting guidance on peri-operative cardiac surveillance and renal protection. After discussion of her stroke history, renal function, blood pressure control, and overall functional capacity, she agreed to continue her antihypertensives up to the morning of surgery, withhold the aspirin as directed by the vascular team, and undergo intra-operative arterial line placement for beat-to-beat monitoring.",What is the patient's score of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk?

259,17,Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk,risk,integer,9,Synthetic,"A 78-year-old man was evaluated this afternoon in the peri-operative medicine clinic at the request of the orthopedic team in anticipation of next week’s elective right total knee arthroplasty for end-stage tricompartmental osteoarthritis causing severe mechanical pain and limitation of ambulation; the procedure is planned under regional anesthesia with a projected operative time of 90 minutes and an overnight hospital stay. He reports that over the past several years the gradual deterioration of his knee has obliged him to use a single-point cane for outdoor walking, and his activity tolerance is roughly two level city blocks at a slow pace before he must pause because of joint discomfort rather than breathlessness or chest pressure. Eight months ago he required admission for worsening lower-extremity swelling and exertional dyspnea that responded to intravenous loop diuretics, and a transthoracic echocardiogram obtained during that hospitalization showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 % with mild global hypokinesis; since discharge he has remained clinically compensated on carvedilol 12.5 mg twice daily, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, and torsemide 20 mg each morning, with no further episodes of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or unplanned clinic visits. For secondary stroke prevention, he takes aspirin 81 mg daily and high-intensity atorvastatin after suffering a small left thalamic infarct three years prior that initially produced transient gait ataxia; he completed outpatient physical therapy, denies any residual focal weakness, and has experienced no recurrent neurologic symptoms such as acute visual changes, speech disturbance, or unilateral numbness. Other long-standing conditions include well-controlled hypertension, stage 3 chronic kidney disease attributed to long-standing vascular disease and prior exposure to intravenous contrast, and hyperlipidemia; he has never been told he has diabetes mellitus and his last fasting plasma glucose six months ago was 101 mg/dL. He quit smoking more than two decades ago after a 25-pack-year history, drinks a glass of red wine with dinner most evenings, and denies illicit drug use. Current home medications also comprise amlodipine 5 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg each morning, vitamin D supplementation, and as-needed acetaminophen for knee pain; no drug allergies are reported. Family history is notable for a brother with heart failure and a mother who sustained a cerebrovascular accident in her 70s; there is no early coronary disease in first-degree relatives. On examination today he appeared comfortable seated in the clinic chair, conversant, and euvolemic. Vital signs: blood pressure 126/68 mm Hg in the right arm seated, heart rate 68 beats per minute and regular, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 97 % on ambient air, oral temperature 36.7 °C, and body mass index 29 kg/m². Neck veins were not distended at 45°, carotid upstrokes were brisk without bruit, and the precordial exam revealed a displaced apical impulse and a soft third heart sound without murmurs or pericardial rub. Lung fields were clear to auscultation with no crackles or wheezes, abdomen was soft and non-tender without organomegaly, and 1+ bilateral ankle pitting edema was present. Neurologic assessment demonstrated intact cranial nerves, full strength, normal coordination, and steady gait with a cane. Pre-operative laboratory studies drawn this morning revealed hemoglobin 12.2 g/dL, hematocrit 36 %, white blood cell count 7.4 × 10⁹/L, platelet count 215 × 10⁹/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 34 mg/dL, and a serum creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, which is consistent with his baseline values over the past year; estimated glomerular filtration rate by CKD-EPI equation calculates to 48 mL/min/1.73 m². Random glucose in clinic measured 104 mg/dL. Electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria and no acute ST-T changes. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram performed six weeks ago at his cardiology follow-up confirmed the prior ejection fraction with stable dimensions, mild concentric hypertrophy, trace mitral regurgitation, and normal right ventricular function. Chest radiograph obtained today shows a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette without pulmonary venous congestion or interstitial edema. He describes adherence to a low-sodium diet, weighs himself daily, and has not required an increase in diuretic dosing for the past four months. Functional capacity on the Duke Activity Status Index questionnaire corresponds to approximately 4 metabolic equivalents, limited primarily by knee pain. The anesthesia service has assessed his airway as Mallampati class II with intact dentition and normal cervical spine mobility; spinal anesthesia with femoral nerve block is favored, and an arterial line is not anticipated. The orthopedic surgeon has requested that beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy be continued through the morning of surgery, whereas the diuretic will be held the day of operation to reduce the risk of intravascular depletion; aspirin will be stopped five days prior per regional anesthesia protocol, and atorvastatin will be continued. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis will consist of mechanical compression intra-operatively followed by low-dose subcutaneous anticoagulation post-operatively once hemostasis is assured. The patient verbalizes clear understanding of the surgical plan, anticipated recovery course, potential cardiac and neurologic risks, and strategies to mitigate postoperative fluid shifts, and he remains eager to proceed in hopes of regaining the ability to walk without assistive devices.",What is the patient's score of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk?

249,17,Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk,risk,integer,4,Synthetic,"A 62-year-old woman presented to the pre-operative medicine clinic three weeks before a scheduled elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. She had been referred by her general surgeon for a comprehensive assessment to optimize medical conditions prior to anesthesia. The patient reported that the biliary colic began approximately eight months earlier and had grown progressively more frequent, prompting the decision for surgery; the operation is planned as a minimally invasive abdominal procedure expected to last under two hours and is not considered particularly hazardous from a cardiovascular standpoint. Past medical history is notable for long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus first diagnosed at age 38. Glycemic control at home relies on a multiple daily injection regimen consisting of basal glargine each night and rapid-acting insulin lispro before meals; she meticulously records glucose values, with most recent self-monitoring logs showing fasting readings in the 110–140 mg/dL range. There is also well-controlled essential hypertension treated with lisinopril 20 mg daily and low-dose hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg each morning. She has hyperlipidemia managed with atorvastatin 40 mg nightly, with a last LDL of 82 mg/dL six months ago. She denies ever experiencing angina, exertional chest tightness, radiation of discomfort to the arm or jaw, or rest pain. She has never been hospitalized for heart-related shortness of breath, fluid overload, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower-extremity edema and has never required diuretics beyond those for blood pressure control. There is no personal history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, carotid artery surgery, or focal neurologic deficits. She has never undergone percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass, or peripheral vascular revascularization. Her exercise tolerance is reasonably good; she walks her dog briskly for 30 minutes daily, climbs two flights of stairs without pausing, and gardens without symptoms. She has no chronic lung disease, takes no inhalers, and has never smoked. Family history reveals a father with myocardial infarction at 72 and a mother with type 2 diabetes; no premature cardiac or cerebrovascular events are reported. She consumes a glass of wine with dinner on weekends and denies illicit drug use. Allergies include a pruritic rash with sulfa antibiotics. Review of systems is negative for palpitations, syncope, orthopnea, nocturnal cough, claudication, or visual disturbances. On examination, she appears well and in no distress, body mass index 31 kg/m². Blood pressure is 132/78 mm Hg in the right arm, heart rate 78 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate 14 breaths/min, temperature 36.8 °C, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Jugular venous pressure is not elevated; carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits. Cardiac auscultation reveals a normal S1 and S2 with no gallops, murmurs, or rubs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft with mild right upper quadrant tenderness but no guarding or rebound. Extremities show no peripheral edema, pulses are 2+ and symmetric. Neurologic examination demonstrates full strength, intact sensation, and normal gait. Laboratory studies obtained the same morning include a basic metabolic panel demonstrating serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 14 mg/dL, sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.3 mmol/L, chloride 102 mmol/L, bicarbonate 26 mmol/L, and glucose 172 mg/dL. Complete blood count is unremarkable with hemoglobin 13.1 g/dL, hematocrit 39.4%, platelets 256 × 10⁹/L, and white blood cell count 6.3 × 10⁹/L. Liver function tests show AST 34 U/L, ALT 30 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 122 U/L, and total bilirubin 1.3 mg/dL. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein and thyroid-stimulating hormone are within reference ranges. Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm at 76 beats/min with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities and a corrected QT of 420 ms. A resting two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram performed by her primary cardiologist two months earlier for a new-patient evaluation demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, normal chamber sizes, and no valvular stenosis or regurgitation of more than mild degree. She is currently taking lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, atorvastatin, and her insulin injections; no beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or antiplatelet agents are prescribed. She fasted overnight before laboratory testing and has not yet begun any peri-operative antibiotics or anticoagulants. The anesthesiology service has reviewed her airway and anticipates no difficulty with intubation. She has been counseled on continuing her usual evening basal insulin with a modest dose reduction the night before surgery and holding rapid-acting insulin on the morning of the procedure while checking point-of-care glucose on arrival to the pre-operative holding area.

The patient had been admitted previously to a local hospital where computer tomography (CT) revealed pleural effusion in both lungs. Laboratory tests showed serum creatinine (sCr) 221.9 μmol/L; proteinuria (3+); and 24 hour proteinuria 5.3g. The patient was diagnosed with chronic renal insufficiency, and pulmonary infection. He was treated with antibiotics for pulmonary infection, but infection-related symptoms gradually worsened and serum creatinine levels reached 434μmol/L within one week. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to our unit for further treatment.
On admission, physical examination showed T 38°C; R, 18 bpm; HR, 99 bpm; and BP 124/60 mmHg. Laboratory tests found hemoglobin (Hb) 81 g/L; WBC 18.27x109/L, ESR 49.0 mm/H, and sCr 611.0 μmol/L; Urea 22.90 mmol/L; antinuclear antibody (ANA) (−); extractable nucler antigen (ENA) (−); C-reactive protein (CRP) 231mg/L; IgG 10.1g/L; IgA 1650.0 mg/L; IgM 345.0 mg/L; IgE 227.95 IU/mL; RBC 30~40/HPF in the

The patient was diagnosed with ANCA-associated vasculitis, AAV associated glomerulonephritis and put on CVVH and antibiotic therapy. After one week, the patient’s infection-related symptoms gradually improved, and the patient was put on intravenous methylprednisolone therapy (80 mg/d).
Four days later, however, the patient developed melana mixed with bloody stool. Laboratory tests revealed Hb 87g/L, Cr 586.9 umol/L, PLT 355×109/L, Fib 2.48 g/L, PT 17.8s, Antithrombin III 92.2%. The gastroscopy and colonoscopy were normal. And capsule endoscopy revealed no obvious abnormalities, including bleeding of mucous membrane. Conventional therapy of GI bleeding (PPI and somatostatin) was ineffective. Finally selective mesenteric arterial angiography was performed, which indicated a hemorrhagic spot in a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery (). Selective transarterial embolization was performed with steel coils (Cook, Bloomington, USA.) (). After the procedure, GI bleeding was completely alleviated. However, two weeks later, the patient presented with hematochezia again and selective transarterial angiography was performed repeatedly, which revealed another hemorrhagic spot in a branch of IMA, and subsequently arterial embolization with coils was performed again (, ).
After TAE, the symptoms improved and three days later, the repeated fecal-occult-blood tests were negative, but the vasculitis was not completely controlled for the other symptoms were still existed. The patient was treated with a course of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (500 mg/d) followed by a course of intravenous cyclophosphamide (CTX) pulse therapy (600mg).

The concentration of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 611.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Pre-Operative Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 611.0 µmol. To convert 611.0 µmol of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 611.0 µmol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.00061 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine. To convert from mol Pre-Operative Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.00061 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.069 g Pre-Operative Creatinine. To convert 0.069 g of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.069 g Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 69.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 69.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/10.0 dL = 6.9 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 611.0 µmol Pre-Operative Creatinine/L converts to 6.9 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/dL. The patient's pre-operative creatinine is greater than 2 mg/dL, so we increment the score by one and the current total will be 0 + 1 = 1.

253,17,Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk,risk,integer,6,Synthetic,"A 66-year-old female is evaluated in the pre-operative medicine clinic at 08:30 this morning for clearance prior to an elective right total knee arthroplasty scheduled in three weeks for debilitating tricompartmental osteoarthritis refractory to physical therapy and oral analgesics. Her past medical history is notable for chronic systolic heart failure that was first diagnosed seven years ago following an episode of acute pulmonary edema; her most recent transthoracic echocardiogram, obtained three months earlier, demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 % with globally reduced wall motion but no significant valvular pathology. She reports that over the past month she can comfortably climb one flight of stairs but becomes mildly short of breath when hurrying on level ground; she sleeps with two pillows and occasionally experiences ankle swelling by evening that responds to an extra dose of her loop diuretic. She denies any recent hospital admissions for volume overload, denies waking up gasping for air, and has not required intravenous diuresis in over a year. Five years ago she suffered a transient episode of left-sided arm weakness and slurred speech that resolved within 24 hours; neuroimaging at that time revealed a small right frontal lacunar infarct, and she has since remained neurologically intact on daily antiplatelet and statin therapy. She has long-standing hypertension, well controlled on her current regimen, and stage 2 chronic kidney disease attributed to hypertensive nephrosclerosis, with a baseline serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL documented on repeat measurements for the past six months. She denies diabetes mellitus, has never taken insulin, and follows a carbohydrate-restricted diet. She has no history of coronary stents, myocardial infarction, or angina-type chest pain, and has never undergone a cardiac catheterization. Her only prior surgical procedure was an uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy at age 50. Current medications include carvedilol 12.5 mg twice daily, lisinopril 20 mg nightly, furosemide 20 mg in the morning with instructions to double the dose for sudden weight gain, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg nightly, and cholecalciferol 1000 IU daily. She does not smoke, consumes alcohol rarely, and denies illicit drug use. On arrival her vital signs are: temperature 36.7 °C, blood pressure 128/72 mmHg in the right arm seated, heart rate 68 beats per minute and regular, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97 % on room air. Physical examination reveals an alert, well-nourished woman in no apparent distress. The jugular venous pulsation is estimated at 6 cm above the sternal angle with the head of the bed at 45 degrees. Cardiac auscultation discloses a soft S3 gallop but no murmurs. Pulmonary fields are clear to percussion with faint bibasilar crackles that clear on deep inspiration. The abdomen is soft and non-tender. There is 1+ pitting edema over both shins without erythema. Peripheral pulses are intact and symmetric. Neurologically she is oriented, cranial nerves II through XII are intact, motor strength is 5/5 in all extremities, sensation is normal, and gait is stable. Laboratory studies obtained this morning show sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, bicarbonate 25 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 24 mg/dL, creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, fasting glucose 102 mg/dL, hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL, platelet count 240 ×10^3/µL, and an INR of 1.0; brain natriuretic peptide is modestly elevated at 250 pg/mL, consistent with her known ventricular dysfunction. Twelve-lead ECG displays normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay and no acute ischemic changes. A pre-operative chest radiograph reveals mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary congestion or effusion. The orthopedic team plans a cemented prosthesis under regional anesthesia with anticipated blood loss under 300 mL and a postoperative stay of three days. After discussion, she agrees to continue her beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor up to and including the day of surgery, hold her diuretic the morning of the procedure to avoid intravascular volume depletion, and remain nil per os after midnight.

264,18,HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events,risk,integer,pmc-7453687-1,Extracted,"A 51- year old male, with no prior medical history, no medication, non-smoker and without risk factors for venous thrombo-embolism arrived at the end of April to the emergency department with exercise induced dyspnea during 4–5 weeks and for the last 48 h dyspnea also at rest. Prior to the onset of symptoms, he had lived socially isolated with his wife from mid-March, approximately 40 days, both working from home and with their two children home from school. He described a short period in the beginning of March, 7 weeks before hospitalization, when he felt difficulties taking deep breaths for a couple of days but no other symptoms like cough, fever or feeling of malaise. Following that episode he experienced a gradually increased fatigue on his regular run and in the beginning of April he had to start walking when running uphill. During the last 5 weeks before hospitalization his wife and daughter had noticed signs of heavy breathing when he walked up the stairs.
Physical examination was normal, examination of the heart and lungs revealed no discrepancies, no swollen legs or other signs of cardiac decompensation. The bodyweight of the patient was 90 kg and his height was 1.88 m, body mass index (BMI) was 25,5 kg/m2. He had normal temperature and a regular heart rate of 80 beats/min. He had a blood pressure of 180/65 mmHg and an oxygen saturation of 93% breathing ambient air. High sensitivity Troponin T was markedly elevated, 1200 (reference < 15 mg/L) and also B-type natriuretic peptide was increased, 737 (reference < 125 ng/L). He had a slightly increased C-reactive protein of 15 (reference < 5 mg/L) and modest leukocytosis 11,7 (normal range 3,5–8,8 × 109/L). ECG showed incomplete right-sided branch block. Computerized Tomography Angiography (CTA) of the chest was performed as pulmonary embolism was suspected. The CTA revealed widespread bilateral segmental pulmonary embolism (Fig. ) and an additional area of consolidation in the right upper lobe consistent with infarction. Additional findings of ground glass opacities that could match Covid-19 were also found (Fig. ). The patient tested negative for SARS -CoV-2 (polymerase chain reaction SARS -CoV-2, GeneXpert, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, United States) at two consecutive nasopharynx tests. No antibody test was performed. The patient was given oxygen and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LWMH), tinzaparin 18,000 units daily during 2 days of hospitalization and was discharged with apixaban 5 mg, twice daily, with a treatment recommendation for 6 months.
Echocardiography revealed dilated right chamber, midventricular diameter of 5 cm and left septum deviation, light to moderate insufficiency of the tricuspid valve with a velocity max of 4,2 m/s. Vena cava inferior showed normal width and breathing variation. Severe pulmonary hypertension with a systolic pulmonary pressure of approximately 75–80 mmHg (normal upper limit 35 mmHg) was present.

271,18,HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events,risk,integer,pmc-4857828-1,Extracted,"A 60-year-old female with past medical history significant for hypertension, DM, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency room with the chief complaint of chest pain. She also reported generalized weakness, myalgias, subjective fever, and chills progressively worsening over the past 7 days. Her physical examination showed stable vital signs and was otherwise unremarkable except for trace peripheral edema. The University of Florida does not require IRB approval or written informed consent for any case report with 3 or fewer patients as it is not a clinical study. 
Fearing a coronary event, she was given a dose of sublingual nitroglycerine and aspirin. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, but otherwise no apparent abnormality. Laboratory workup was significant for elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) of 13,456 U/L (reference range: 30–170 U/L), normal troponin-T, normal complete blood count, and basic metabolic panel except elevated creatinine of 1.20 mg/dL (reference range: 0.40–0.90 mg/dL). Her chest X-ray revealed no abnormality. CPK levels evaluated in 2012 on this patient while on statins were unremarkable (191 U/L, 165 U/L, and 197 U/L, with reference range of 30–170 U/L). 
She was admitted to the hospital due to concern for acute coronary event, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal insufficiency, and possible acute viral infection causing her symptoms. Her workup during hospital stay showed three normal serial troponin-T tests, and myocardial perfusion test revealed no abnormality. Her respiratory viral panel and thyroid stimulation hormone level were normal. Her creatinine also normalized with intravenous (IV) fluids. She had persistent elevated CPK levels, which also trended down with IV fluids. 
Common differential diagnoses for her rhabdomyolysis were explored by detailed history and laboratory workup. There was no history of recent trauma, crush injury, prolonged immobilization, recent surgery, seizures, drug abuse, or alcoholism. Her family history was negative for any kind of myopathy or other hereditary or genetic causes that could explain the elevated CPK value. Her laboratory workup, including thyroid function tests, was unremarkable and failed to explain this episode of rhabdomyolysis. She had been on a stable dose of atorvastatin (40 mg) for several years for hyperlipidemia and reported no myalgias, arthralgias, or abnormal CPK levels. Review of her medication list further revealed that she was started on sitagliptin (Januvia® 100 mg) almost a week before this presentation. She also correlated her symptoms with starting of this new medication. Sitagliptin and atorvastatin were stopped; her subsequent CPK value showed a decreasing trend and was recorded at 1,220 U/L on the day of discharge.

262,18,HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events,risk,integer,pmc-8509094-1,Extracted,"A 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) in April 2021 for altered mental status. His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.
Approximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9° Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.
Three months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.
In addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).
Of note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml.

The patient has a history of decompensated hepatic cirrhosis that started 1 year ago complicated by ascites and a large umbilical hernia. The patient has had multiple paracentesis and had several episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. His medication list included tramadol and propranolol. Upon admission to the emergency department, he was found to be severely malnourished with significant loss of muscle mass, abdominal distention, and the presence of a large, tender, compressible umbilical hernia. Physical exam showed flank dullness, a fluid wave, and shifting dullness. Vital signs were normal, and he did not show signs of asterixis, hepatic encephalopathy, edema, or fluid overload elsewhere. His white blood cell (WBC) count was high at 10,270/µL and hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 32.6%, and a platelet count of 130,000/µL. Further testing showed hyponatremia at 133 mmol/L and a total bilirubin of 1.9 mg/dL. Liver function test revealed an albumin of 2.9 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 149 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 64 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 36 U/L. X-ray confirmed large-volume ascites and the presence of a ventral hernia. Abdominal ultrasound showed cirrhotic liver morphology with large-volume ascites and splenomegaly. Ascitic fluid was yellow, and analysis showed WBC count of 70/µL, but was otherwise unremarkable. After being admitted to the hospital, patient was given furosemide 40 mg tablet daily and spironolactone 100 mg tablet daily. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further management. Surgical consultation was sought, and since the patient was a very high-risk surgical candidate with loss of muscle mass, surgical intervention was not planned. The patient chose supportive care and prophylactic antibiotics based on infectious disease recommendations. An ostomy pouch was placed over the hernia to prevent bacterial contamination and peritonitis as well as to collect the ascitic fluid. The patient’s severe abdominal pain subsided and was discharged to follow up with his primary care physician.
Three months after the patient was discharged, he came back to the hospital with worsening symptoms because he could not afford the ostomy pouches. He was not compliant with his follow-ups. His umbilical hernia appeared to have worsened, and ascitic fluid was leaking out from multiple areas on his hernia, and there were also multiple areas of skin necrosis. Since the patient was deemed a high-risk surgical candidate, he was, again, not cleared for surgery. The patient opted for conservative care and prophylactic antibiotics according to infectious disease suggestions. After symptoms improved, he was instructed on being more compliant and then subsequently discharged.",What is the patient's score of the Fibrosis 4 Index?

A month later, she underwent CP shunt placement for cyst formation after resection. The postoperative course was uneventful and she was well without shunt-related problems for 26 years. She developed a brain abscess related to the shunt catheter at the age of 55. A surgical removal of the catheter was attempted, but was not technically possible, and only the segment from the clavicle to the breast was removed with ligation of the two remaining ends. The two disconnected catheter segments remained in situ and were not retrieved. A year later, she was taken to a local hospital with continuous right-breast pain. The diagnosis of acute mastitis was made and she was referred to our institution for further examination. On presentation, her right breast was swollen with erythema (Fig. ). There was no abdominal pain and change in bowel habits. Funduscopic evaluation was normal with no signs of increased intracranial pressure. Her temperature was 36.7°C, and laboratory tests revealed a decreased platelet count of 103 000/μl, elevated AST of 97 U/l, ALT of 72 U/l and C-reactive protein level of 1.4 mg/dl. The breast abscess was drained under local anesthesia. Cultures taken from the abscess showed enteric organisms including Enterococcus avium, Klebsiella oxytoca and Bacillus. Abdominal CT showed that the shunt catheter was in the splenic flexure of the transverse colon with no other abnormalities (Fig. ). Colonoscopy was performed to survey the colon and the shunt catheter was found inside the lumen at the splenic flexure (Fig. ). Acute mastitis caused by enteric organisms which had migrated through the shunt catheter after penetration into the transverse colon was the presumptive diagnosis, and the catheter removed under general anesthesia.

The medical history of patient revealed that he was diagnosed as a hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier about 20 years earlier, but was lost to follow up. The patient was not a heavy drinker or smoker. There was no significant family history. On physical examination, a palpable and hard mass was noted in the right pelvic area. Hepatomegaly, liver masses, and ascites were absent. Initial laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 4,830/µL, hemoglobin 15.2 g/dL, platelets 138,000/µL, total protein 7.8 g/dL, albumin 4.4 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 31 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 35 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL, alkaline phosphate 98 IU/L, prothrombin time 14 second (INR 1.21), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 15.01 ng/mL, and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) 864 mAU/mL. Hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) were positive. Hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), HBV-DNA with polymerase chain reaction, and serological markers of hepatitis C were negative. He belonged to Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A.
For evaluation of the pelvic mass, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed. They demonstrated a 13×10 cm expansile mass that involved the right iliac bone (). The patient underwent an incisional biopsy with the impression of a malignant bone tumor. However, on pathological examination, the tumor was composed of polygonal cells with ample cytoplasm and trabecular pattern. In immunohistochemical stains, these tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), hepatocyte paraffin 1 (HepPar1), and glypican-3, which confirmed the diagnosis of HCC (). Tumor cells were negative for CD56, chromogranin A and synaptophysin, which are the markers of neuroendocrine differentiation. To find the primary focus, abdominal CT, MRI, positron emission tomography (PET) scans and angiography were performed. However, no tumor was found in the liver in these radiologic examinations.
We diagnosed this case as an isolated metastatic HCC of the pelvic bone without the presence of a primary cancer in the liver. Surgical resection of the tumor was recommended, but the patient refused an operation because of old age and the large size of the tumor. Instead, we decided to treat him with combined modalities. He started radiotherapy in the pelvic area with a total dose of 5,100 cGy in 17 fractions. One week after the end of radiotherapy, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed in the metastatic HCC of the pelvic bone via the right internal iliac artery (adriamycin 50 mg and 20 mL of lipiodol). Then, the patient was treated with five cycles of systemic chemotherapy based on 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU, 1,000 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3) and cisplatin (90 mg/m2 on day 2 every 4 weeks). After the completion of chemotherapy, the tumor became almost necrotic. The AFP and PIVKA-II levels decreased to the normal ranges (2.85 ng/mL and 28 mAU/mL, respectively). As the treatment resulted in near complete regression of the tumor, the patient underwent close follow-up without chemotherapy. However, 12 months after chemotherapy, a CT scan revealed multiple lung metastases in both lungs with increasing AFP and PIVKA-II levels (182 ng/mL and 38 mAU/mL, respectively). He was treated with two cycles of systemic chemotherapy with the same regimen (5-FU 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 2 and 3 and cisplatin 90 mg/m2 on day 2). After two cycles of chemotherapy, the patient refused additional chemotherapy and we provided him with supportive care thereafter.

The patient had a series of comorbidities: hepatic steatosis, chronic alcohol liver disease, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease, and essential hypertension.
Objective examination showed an agitated, tachypneic patient, with congested facies, dry skin and mucosae, harsh vesicular murmur, right basal crepitant rales, with peripheral oxygen saturation 92%, blood pressure 200/160 mmHg, ventricular rate 106 bpm, afebrile at the time of examination.
Chest X-ray evidenced a pulmonary condensation area in the posterior inferior third of the right lung (A,B).
Laboratory tests revealed leukopenia with lymphopenia (white blood cells 1110/μL, lymphocytes 190/μL), thrombocytopenia (127,000/μL), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (15.6 s), international normalized ratio (INR) 1.15, hepatocytolysis (aspartate aminotransferase 88.8 units/L, alanine aminotransferase 82.8 units/L), total bilirubin 2.88 mg/dL, reduced creatinine clearance (63.8 mL/min), nitrogen retention (creatinine 1.82 mg/dL), inflammatory syndrome (C-reactive protein 450 mg/L), antibodies against HIV-1 and HIV-2 were not detectable, nonreactive anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies. Combined throat/nasal sampling (with collection device produced by Sanimed International Impex, Bucharest, Romania) was performed for real-time PCR (RT-PCR) SARS CoV-2 (QuantStudio v5 analysis method with TaqPath COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR Kit, The QuantStudioTM Design & Analysis Software, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pleasanton, CA, USA). The result was negative. Respiratory secretions were not collected for microbiological diagnosis.
The diagnosis of right basal pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, acute chronic liver dysfunction, and acute kidney injury was established. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Anti-inflammatory steroid, antibiotic, antihypertensive, oxygen therapy was initiated. The patient died 17 h after presentation.
The necropsy was performed 12 h after death. Necropsy exam revealed the following: about 1700 mL of serous fluid in the right pleural cavity, with gray deposits, which were also present focally on the surface of the right pleura, and about 500 mL of serous citrine fluid in the left pleural cavity. The middle lower lobe of the right lung had a well-demarcated red-gray area, with small violaceous areas of increased consistency, having a dry, granular cross section surface. The adrenal glands showed bilateral medullary hemorrhage. No signs of autolysis were identified.
Given the persistence of the suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, five lung fragments (0.5/0.3 cm) were collected by cutting with scalpel from the red-gray area, middle lower lobe (with collection device produced by Sanimed International Impex, Bucharest, Romania). RT-PCR testing was performed on these lung fragments and the result was positive. Total RNA isolation was performed with NucleoSpin RNA for tissue (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The E gene assay (Envelope gene) was used as the first line screening tool (Ct 23) then followed by confirmatory testing with an RdRp gene assay (Ct 25.3) (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene—inside the Orf1ab polyprotein gene) and N gene assay (Ct 26.5) according to the Charite/Berlin protocol [].
For the histopathological examination, we used an Olympus BX40 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) with an Olympus Camedia 4040 photo camera, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain (staining kit produced by Laboratorium, Bucharest, Romania), Giemsa stain (staining kit produced by Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain (staining kit produced by Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and Grocott stain (staining kit produced in our own laboratory). For immunohistochemistry, CD3 (Dako, polyclonal rabbit anti-human) and CD45 (Dako, monoclonal mouse antihuman, clone 2B11 + PD7/26) were used. The immunolabeling reaction was carried out by an automated immunostainer (Leica Bond-Max, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) using a polymer-based detection system (Leica Biosystems, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) with 3,3′-diaminobenzidin (DAB) as the chromogen.
The histopathological examination of the case evidenced preexisting lesions in various organs, which could be assigned to preexisting morbidities, favoring the severe evolution of COVID-19 infection. The histopathological examination also detected recent lesions occurring in the context of COVID-19 infection.
In the lung tissue, a background of lung fibrosis (A), with emphysematous areas (B) and thickened septa with myofibroblasts (C,D) was seen.
On this fibrosis background, the large and small arterial lung vessels show many thromboses (). The thromboses are accompanied by subpleural hemorrhagic foci (Tardieu spots, resulting from acute hypoxia), as well as by acute pulmonary edema foci in the rare alveoli unoccupied by inflammatory exudate. In the thrombosed vessels, lymphocytes adherent to the endothelium, with a significance of endotheliitis () but with low intensity, can be seen. In the dilated perivascular lymphatics, there is a cell-rich lymph fluid, with a cellularity similar to that of alveolar exudate (A).
Eosinophilic (A) and basophilic microthrombi (B) can also be observed, which represent aspects of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
The alveolar exudate is rich in foam cells ( and ). Alveolar exudate immunolabeling is positive for the leukocyte common antigen (CD45, a commonly used marker of hematopoietic cells except for erythrocytes and platelets) (A), but negative for CD3 (a common antibody for identifying T cells) (B). Immunolabeling of the innate immune system cells for induced nitric oxide (iNOS) is extremely weak ().
In the alveoli filled with macrophages, cystic forms with multinuclear content were also present (B). These proved to be positive by Giemsa stain (A,B), Grocott-Gomori’s methenamine silver stain (C), and PAS stain (D).
Giemsa stain also evidenced the fact that focally, some alveoli were invaded by a population of filamentous bacteria, in those areas the alveolar exudate having a bronchopneumonic, bacterial superinfection appearance ().
In the pleura, the whitish exudate described macroscopically was a mixture of fibrin and basophilic granular material, rich in round cells with vesicular nuclei. These cells were positive by Giemsa and Grocott staining, supporting the diagnosis of pneumocystosis (). Starting from these pleural images suggestive of Pneumocystis, it was inferred that the foamy alveolar material phagocyted by the activated macrophages was probably identical to this basophilic granular material, and the cystic forms described in were Pneumocystis cystic forms.
The myocardial muscle fibers are hypertrophied and fragmented, and in the medium intramyocardial venous vessels, rare microthrombi are present (A). In the liver, alcoholic steatosis is seen. In the medium and large branches of the suprahepatic veins, there is inflammatory infiltrate which allows the diagnosis of phlebitis (B). The kidney presents diffuse tubular necrosis (shock kidney) (C), and in the adrenal glands, massive medullary hemorrhage can be observed (D). The kidneys (mainly located within the interstitium) and liver (portal spaces and sinusoids) are CD45 positive.",What is the patient's score of the Fibrosis 4 Index?

914,21,Glasgow Coma Score (GCS),severity,integer,14,Synthetic,"A 58-year-old male was brought to the emergency department after being found disoriented and stumbling around a grocery store parking lot, according to bystanders who contacted local emergency services. On arrival, he was sitting on the curb, appearing confused and slightly agitated, with no clear indication of how long he had been in that spot or what precipitated his apparent distress. Witnesses stated that he had been seen wavering on his feet, occasionally calling out random statements that did not match any observable context. During transport, paramedics noted that he seemed restless and kept glancing around as though looking for someone, yet he maintained the ability to open his eyes with no apparent hesitation, reacting to the presence of people around him and even shifting his gaze toward movement or sound. On initial examination in the department, his vital signs showed a slightly elevated blood pressure of 142/88 mmHg, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. He had a mildly increased temperature reading of 99.2°F, although it was uncertain whether this reflected a feverish process or some other factor. He answered questions with audible speech, but the phrases he used were largely unrelated to the questions, consisting of words and references that did not align logically with the conversation. When asked his name, he provided a string of words referencing places that had no connection to his identity, though he spoke them clearly enough to be recognized as actual words. Despite this inappropriate pattern of speech, he occasionally appeared to notice the medical staff, making fleeting eye contact and switching his focus from one person to another without obvious comprehension of their roles. Examination of his motor abilities revealed that he was relatively able to move all limbs, though when asked to perform simple tasks, he offered no consistent cooperation. However, when clinical personnel applied slight pressure over his forearm and later near his clavicle as part of a neurological evaluation, he brought his hand directly to the source of discomfort and attempted to dislodge it with some accuracy. This movement suggested that, while his mental clarity was compromised, he sensed painful stimuli and could pinpoint where the sensation was located, steering the examiner’s hand away rather than merely withdrawing reflexively. His past medical records, obtained after identification through a wallet card, revealed a history of mild bipolar disorder and prior medication for hypertension, though there was no record of recent psychiatric hospitalizations or significant neurological events. He occasionally visited a primary care provider, as indicated by partial documentation of medication refills, but the last documented appointment was nearly a year prior. Further assessment showed no overt signs of head trauma or fresh bruising, though there were older marks on his arms that might have been from prior incidents or accidental bumps. His pupils were equal and responded to light, with no apparent asymmetry in response time or constriction. Cardiovascular examination showed normal heart sounds, and his lung fields were clear to auscultation, indicating no current respiratory compromise. Despite his confused verbal content, he remained sufficiently alert to notice objects placed in front of him, though he made little effort to interact meaningfully with any provided items such as a cup of water or a blanket. The team initiated basic laboratory workup, including a toxicology screen, given the unclear circumstances leading to his presentation, and imaging studies were requested to exclude intracranial processes such as hemorrhage or ischemia. Throughout this initial phase of assessment, he continued to spontaneously shift his gaze to whomever approached and occasionally mumbled words that bore no relevance to the immediate setting, suggesting a significant cognitive disturbance but leaving some intact ability to be aware of his environment. Although his speech was evidently disorganized, his purposeful reach toward uncomfortable stimuli underscored that he retained a notable aspect of protective motor function. No specific treatment had been administered at this early stage, aside from supportive care and routine precautionary measures, as the clinical team endeavored to gather further diagnostic information and identify any underlying contributors, whether metabolic, psychiatric, or neurological in nature.

920,21,Glasgow Coma Score (GCS),severity,integer,20,Synthetic,"A 64-year-old female was brought to the emergency department after being found slumped in the passenger seat of her vehicle outside a small convenience store by a passerby who noticed that she did not respond to repeated knocks on the window. According to the initial report from the individual who summoned assistance, she had been sitting there in the same position for an undetermined amount of time, with her head resting against the window and no observable reactions when they attempted to garner her attention through polite gestures. On arrival, paramedics observed that she made no effort to open her eyelids in response to normal conversation or louder vocal prompts, and even gentle attempts at nudging her shoulder elicited minimal reaction aside from occasional slow murmurs that suggested she was at least partially aware of her surroundings. She did manage to speak in incomplete but coherent phrases at times, responding to basic inquiries about how she felt, yet the content of her answers showed clear signs of disorientation. When asked about the current day or location, she provided statements that were confusing or unrelated, such as referencing an unrelated setting she believed she had just visited earlier, which conflicted with the eyewitness account that she had been parked at that convenience store for well over an hour. Her mental status appeared muddled, as she repeated some questions back and then trailed off into silence, giving no firm grasp of the reality of the situation. Despite this perplexed speech pattern, when explicitly directed to perform simple motor tasks, she demonstrated an ability to comply with specific requests. For instance, she could raise her right arm when asked, and later, she was able to release and reapply her grip on a nurse’s hand upon repeated instruction. These actions indicated that her strength and coordination were at least somewhat intact and that she was able to comprehend spoken commands on a rudimentary level. However, she continued to keep her eyes firmly shut through most of the examination, remaining passive and largely still, except when asked to move or shift as part of the clinician’s assessment. Her past medical records, retrieved from an old hospital card located in her wallet, mentioned a prior hospitalization several years ago for an ischemic stroke that allegedly left her with mild residual weakness in her left leg, although there was no documentation of any severe long-term mobility limitations. She also had a documented history of labile blood pressure, often swinging towards the higher end of normal, for which she had been prescribed medication in the past. It was unclear whether she had been adhering to that medication regimen in recent months. Family members, who were reached by telephone shortly after her arrival, mentioned that she had occasionally reported episodes of dizziness and general fatigue, but they had not noticed any acute changes in her mental status until just a few days prior, when she started to appear withdrawn and less interactive during phone calls. She reportedly had some difficulty recalling recent conversations, although she was not formally evaluated for cognitive decline. On direct questioning in the emergency department—prior to any administration of sedatives, analgesics, or other treatments—she sometimes managed a mumbled acknowledgment that she was uncomfortable but displayed no voluntary attempt to open her eyes or appropriately orient herself to the exam area. Repeated tests of her neurological function showed that she could be prompted to execute tasks involving intentional movement of limbs, such as bending her arm or lifting her foot, yet she never lifted her eyelids spontaneously or displayed any apparent reaction to vivid visual stimuli passing in front of her face. There was no active resistance to gentle manipulations, and when her blood pressure cuff inflated, she followed a request to hold her arm still and then release it on command. Her vitals revealed a heart rate slightly above normal, with borderline elevated pressure readings and respirations that were steady but somewhat shallow, though not urgently concerning. No significant cuts or bruises were found on her head or neck, and she did not complain of headache when queried. A more comprehensive workup was launched, including blood tests to check for renal function imbalances or possible infectious processes, imaging studies to rule out a new cerebrovascular event, and a toxicological screen to exclude possible external contributors. Throughout the initial evaluation period, she continued to speak in short, jumbled statements that hinted at an underlying confusion, sometimes contradicting her previously stated words without seeming to realize the disparity. Her expression remained passive, and she maintained a lack of visual engagement, even when staff gently raised her eyelids to assess pupil size and reaction. While she did show a positive response to direct commands that required purposeful limb movement, her overall presentation was one of perplexity and reduced awareness, warranting immediate investigation into potential causes of this change in mental status and persistent lack of visual opening.",What is the patient's Glasgow Coma Score?

918,21,Glasgow Coma Score (GCS),severity,integer,18,Synthetic,"A 57-year-old male was brought to the emergency department by a neighbor who found him lying on the floor of his home in the late afternoon, with his eyes already open but seemingly unaware of the voices and movement around him. According to brief information gathered from the neighbor, the patient had been in declining health for several weeks, and he had recently complained about feeling persistently weak and lightheaded, though he never clearly explained if he sought any formal medical evaluation. On arrival, he did not utter any recognizable words or make any vocal sounds despite persistent attempts by the emergency team to gain his attention with varied tones, including calmly calling his name and then slowly increasing the volume of commands. Throughout these efforts, he kept his gaze forward, blinking occasionally but failing to follow any moving objects or turn his head toward staff members. His vital signs at the time of entry suggested mild tachycardia and a blood pressure that was within a borderline range, neither acutely alarming nor completely normal. Respirations were slow but rhythmic, prompting the examining clinician to ensure that his airway remained patent, especially given his lack of any verbal output. A look into his pockets provided only a set of house keys and a folded sheet listing several medications, though it was unclear if he had been taking them consistently or if the list was up to date. Examination of his head and neck revealed a small bruise over the left temple, though the skin was not broken and there was no active bleeding; it was unclear whether this finding signaled recent trauma or an incidental bump that had occurred days earlier. Further neurological assessment showed that, while he did not offer words or audible attempts at speech, his eyes remained open the entire time without any prompting to keep them that way. When gentle touch was replaced with more focused pressure to gauge whether he would react, he did indeed respond, yet the nature of his movements was not aligned with purposeful withdrawal or an effort to push the examiner’s hand away. Instead, his limbs stiffened and extended outward, a pattern that repeated each time staff applied even moderate noxious stimuli. No clear attempt to localize or grasp at the source of discomfort was noted, though the sudden tensing of arms and legs revealed he could perceive painful sensations to some degree. A colleague from the laboratory arrived to draw blood for urgent metabolic panels, suspecting that his undetermined condition could be linked to blood sugar imbalances, electrolyte derangements, or possible renal issues given his age and uncertain medication use. The patient’s skin was somewhat cool, and staff observed a faint film of perspiration on his forehead, but there was no frank cyanosis. Pupils were symmetrical and responded to light, though he neither tracked the flashlight nor blinked at direct visual cues. The neighbor mentioned that he had lived alone for at least a decade without close family nearby, so it was unclear if he had a recent infection, an underlying cardiac condition, or any psychiatric history that might have led to his current state. No strong odors of alcohol or other substances were detected, and there were no obvious pill bottles scattered around the immediate area where he was found. Nonetheless, toxicology screening was also arranged to explore whether an unintentional or deliberate ingestion might have contributed to this presentation. Imaging of his head and cervical spine was ordered promptly to rule out an acute traumatic injury or bleed, particularly given the bruise on his temple and the lack of clear historical detail as to how he ended up on the floor. Prior to any interventions, he remained on the stretcher with his eyes still open, his posture rigid whenever discomfort was introduced, and no sign of an attempt to speak or mouth words despite repeated efforts by the team to elicit a verbal reaction. The clinical staff stood by for rapid intervention if his breathing deteriorated or if further evidence of a more serious neurologic compromise emerged, keeping open lines of communication with diagnostic services to clarify the cause of his unresponsive state.

901,21,Glasgow Coma Score (GCS),severity,integer,1,Synthetic,"A 57-year-old male arrived at the emergency department following a reported fall down a flight of stairs at home, where he was found lying unconscious by family members. On arrival, his airway was patent, though he appeared to be struggling to maintain a clear and consistent breathing pattern, with shallow respirations and occasional brief pauses between breaths. Family members reported that he has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, both of which had been managed inconsistently due to multiple missed appointments. They also noted that he had complained of occasional headaches in the weeks leading up to this event, although he had not sought medical attention for them. At the time of initial assessment, his face and scalp showed abrasions consistent with a traumatic impact, including a small laceration near the left temporal region that was oozing a mild amount of blood. Further inspection revealed several contusions on both forearms, suggesting that he may have attempted to protect himself during the fall. His blood pressure was slightly elevated, and his pulse was somewhat rapid but still within a range that did not necessitate immediate cardiovascular intervention. He did not respond to verbal requests with any clear words, instead producing only muffled vocalizations without apparent meaning. When staff members addressed him loudly or attempted to gain his attention, there was no evident reaction in terms of rational speech or acknowledgment. Rather, he made low, throaty sounds that indicated some level of arousal but lacked coherent structure. In addition, he did not open his eyes spontaneously, even when spoken to or gently shaken by a nurse. It was only after a stronger stimulus, such as a firm press on the nail bed, that he briefly parted his eyelids, though he appeared to track nothing in the room and exhibited no purposeful gaze. His pupils were equal and reactive, but his gaze remained largely unfocused. On further neurological examination, when he was subjected to a more rigorous pressure stimulus—applied centrally—he bent his arms and pulled them inward in a manner suggestive of a non-purposeful withdrawal pattern. There was no attempt to push away the examiner or localize the exact site of discomfort, indicating a diminished ability to perform more discriminating motor responses at this time. Additionally, his legs twitched slightly during these stimuli, but he did not produce any overriding extension pattern in the lower extremities, nor did he attempt to move his body away in a directed manner. Vital signs revealed a heart rate elevated above normal resting levels, a blood pressure that remained high relative to his baseline as reported by his family, and a respiratory rate on the lower end of normal, with occasional erratic variations. Auscultation of his chest did not reveal definitive signs of aspiration, but his breathing pattern warranted close observation, and preparations were made to secure his airway if his respiratory effort continued to fluctuate. A review of his past records showed no documented history of cerebrovascular accidents or prior major trauma, though he did have a past admission for diabetic ketoacidosis, indicating some degree of metabolic vulnerability. At the time of presentation, he showed no purposeful communication and evidenced only fragmentary reactions to painful provocation, prompting immediate imaging studies to rule out intracranial hemorrhage or significant structural injury. Given the patient’s limited responsiveness and the uncertain nature of his injuries, he was placed under close neurological observation prior to initiating any definitive interventions. The clinical impression was of a severely altered mental status necessitating meticulous monitoring and further diagnostic workup.

On arrival, her vital signs showed a heart rate slightly above normal limits, with blood pressure on the higher end of her usual range based on prior medical documentation. Her respirations were notably shallow, and her oxygen saturation required supplemental oxygen to remain at acceptable levels. She has a past medical history including mild hypertension diagnosed a few years ago, but no significant prior neurological events. Family also mentioned that she had not been feeling well for the past two days, perhaps due to a viral illness, though there was no clear indication that she had sought medical care for it. Examination at the time of presentation revealed that she neither opened her eyes spontaneously nor did she visibly respond when spoken to in a normal voice. Repeated attempts to engage her by calling her name and clapping near her ears were unsuccessful, although she did show a reaction when firm pressure was applied to her sternum and supraorbital notch, indicating a complete lack of spontaneous visual attention but some response to more intense stimuli. When these painful stimuli were applied, her limbs stiffened and rotated outward in a pattern that suggested a severe lesion in the brain stem or upper motor tracts rather than a purposeful withdrawal or flexion. This posture raised immediate concern among the emergency team, as it typically points to a more advanced neurological compromise. On further assessment of her speech and interaction, she was able to utter individual words that did not form coherent sentences or appropriate replies to questions. For instance, when asked about her name, she replied with random expressions unrelated to personal details or the environment, and she quickly descended into incomprehensible vocalizations that were neither groans nor normal language. She seemed incapable of maintaining any meaningful conversation, and there was no sign of consistent orientation to person, place, or time. Her pupils were moderately sized and reactive to light, but their reaction was sluggish, and there was no symmetrical tracking of objects placed before her eyes. A quick survey of her cardiovascular and pulmonary systems yielded no immediate abnormalities aside from the elevated heart rate and the need for oxygen supplementation. Skin turgor was normal, and there were no distinct signs of trauma on her head or cervical spine, though she did have an older scar on her forehead that might have been from a previous injury, according to her family’s report of past falls. No significant bruising was found along the torso or extremities, and she did not have any obvious contusions or lacerations that might suggest a recent external injury. At the time of this initial evaluation, she was not moving spontaneously and appeared unable to follow any commands, even simple ones such as showing two fingers or moving a thumb. Her reflexes were unremarkable except for the abnormal posture elicited by painful stimuli. Based on these clinical findings, the team recognized an urgent need for further imaging and laboratory work to explore possible causes, including intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, or other acute neurological insults. Efforts were made to stabilize her airway and circulation while obtaining more diagnostic information, but no specific therapeutic interventions had been provided before this detailed neurologic evaluation was completed.",What is the patient's Glasgow Coma Score?

1. Best Eye Response: Spontaneously = +4 points, To verbal command = +3 points, To pain = +2 points, No eye opening = +1 point
2. Best Verbal Response: Oriented = +5 points, Confused = +4 points, Inappropriate words = +3 points, Incomprehensible sounds = +2 points, No verbal response = +1 point
3. Best Motor Response: Obeys commands = +6 points, Localizes pain = +5 points, Withdrawal from pain = +4 points, Flexion to pain = +3 points, Extension to pain = +2 points, No motor response = +1 point

For each criteria, if a patient's value is not mentioned/not testable in the note, we assume that it gets the full score for that attribute.  The total GCS score is calculated by summing the points for each of the three components.
    
The current glasgow coma score is 0.
Based on the patient note, the best eye response for the patient is 'no eye opening', and so we add 1 point making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
Based on the patient note, the best verbal response for the patient is 'inappropriate words', and so we add 3 points making the current total 1 + 3 = 4.
Based on the patient note, the best motor response for the patient is 'extension to pain', and so we add 2 points making the current total 4 + 2 = 6.
Hence, the patient's glasgow coma score is 6."

Impaired growth was noted (weight 39.5 kg; height 146 cm; BMI 17.6 kg/m). She had a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 226/136 mmHg, respiration rate of 16 breaths per minute and arterial oxygen saturation of 96%. Blood analysis showed a serum creatinine level of 10.97 mg/dl (nv 0.5-1.1) and urea 109 mg/dL (nv 16-46) mmol/L. The patient also presented with bilateral AMLs, hypertension and seizure disorder. Her relatives reported difficulty in managing her home medications (antihypertensive and antiepileptic drugs) due to her intellectual disability. The patient had been diagnosed with TSC in childhood; there was a paternal family history of TSC. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in end-stage renal failure appeared four years prior and the patient has been undergoing peritoneal dialysis since the diagnosis. At the age of 18 years, she underwent a prior unilateral endovascular embolization to treat renal aneurisms and the procedure successfully stopped a bleeding aneurism at the upper pole of the right kidney. Based on the patient’s medical history, clinical and biochemical findings, a ruptured renal artery aneurysm was diagnosed. An urgent renal AE was considered the treatment of choice to limit hemorrhage and the risk of damage to the peritoneal dialysis catheter. The multidisciplinary team, including pediatric surgeons, interventional radiologists, pediatric nephrologists and psychologists agreed upon the choice to perform a bilateral renal AE in this complex patient. Prior to the intervention, and after being informed on the nature of the intervention, the patient and the patient’s parents gave their written consent to undergo endovascular treatment. Under general anesthesia, ultrasound-guided right femoral common artery access was gained using a Terumo 6 FR 11 cm catheter. A diagnostic plain angiography scan revealed a double right renal artery. The major artery was easily catheterized with a 6 FR C2 Mac Boston-Scientific 6 F (65 cm) catheter. Through this catheter, a AMplatzer Plug-2 10 mm was released achieving artery occlusion (about 1 cm from the ostium, ). A Sim1 Boston-Scientific 5 fr was positioned in the lower right renal artery and several Terumo Azur coils were released (). Upon completion of the intervention, angiography confirmed the complete embolization of the vessels (). The same procedure was used for the left renal embolization using a Cobra C2 catheter and Terumo 4x10 mm Azur coils (). With the final angiography, bilateral renal arterialthrombosis was confirmed (about 1 cm from the ostium, ). The first cm of the renal artery was preserved to facilitate clamping during the future nephrectomy. After the procedure, the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of our institution for observation and subsequently to the pediatric nephrology unit. Vital signs were monitored; her postoperative course was uneventful. Two months later, the patient underwent a bilateral lumbotomy and bilateral extraperitoneal nephrectomy to protect the peritoneal surface area and dialysis adequacy. Grossly, both kidneys were enlarged (left 14.5x7x6 cm; right 15x5x5.5 cm); macroscopically the tissue was almost entirely replaced by cysts alternating with solid grey and brown areas, on a background of soft and yellowish tissue with calcific deposits. Histologically, solid areas on the yellowish background were revealed to be angiomyolipoma, which extended to the adipose tissue, perirenal and the renal pelvis. Partially solid aspects (epithelioid angiomyolipoma) and partially cystic aspects (cysts with cubic or hobnail epithelium) were observed. In the right kidney, other solid greyish areas were observed (maximum diameter 15 mm); these were classified as renal cell carcinomas (RCC), with acinar, papillary and alveolar growth patterns and cribiform aspects, Furhrman grade III (). The patient was discharged on the fourth day of hospitalization in stable clinical condition. Her clinical condition and laboratory tests were stable at 12 months follow-up.

She was a case of hypothyroidism since last 4 years on oral thyroxine 50 mcg once a day. Her laboratory investigations were within normal limits except that liver function test showed serum albumin of 2.1 g/L initially which improved to 3.4 g/L with high protein formula feed for 1-month period of evaluation and optimization. Preoperative electrocardiogram and 2D-echocardiogram were normal. Her effort tolerance was more than 4 METs. Preoperative pulmonary function test (PFT) showed FEV1 1.13 Litres (47.3% of predicted) with moderate restriction due to the lung metastases with small airway obstruction. Patient was started on bronchodilator therapy for the same. Diffusion capacity (DLCO) was 81% of predicted. A written informed consent was taken for surgery and anaesthesia. She was kept fasting for solid food for 8 hours. She received clear carbohydrate drink in previous evening and morning of surgery as per institutional protocol. In the operating room, ECG, non-invasive blood pressure and pulse oximetry were attached and base line parameters noted. A 16G intravenous cannula was secured and epidural catheter was placed in T7-8 interspace in left lateral position. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl (100 mcg), propofol (110 mg) and vecuronium (6mg) and was maintained on sevoflurane in a gaseous mixture of oxygen with nitrous oxide. The monitoring was then advanced to include invasive arterial blood pressure with pulse pressure variation (PPV), central venous pressure and monitoring with the help of FloTrac including cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume (SV), stroke volume index and stroke volume variation (SVV), as well as oesophageal temperature monitoring. CRS phase was started and total peritonectomy with total abdominal hysterectomy plus omenectomy, splenectomy, cholecystectomy and liver portal metastasis clearance was done. Bilateral diaphragmatic stripping was done for metastatic deposits. Debulking surgery of left thorax (large deposits over left lung) through left phrenotomy was done for pleural and lung PMP. A small part of left lower lobe was also resected. During debulking of thorax, a very low tidal volume (4 ml/kg) ventilation was started. CRS phase lasted for 12 hours with a total volume loss (blood mixed) during CRS phase was 6.5 liter, mostly constituted by jelly-like mucinous material. During abdominal debulking, fluid therapy was guided by PPV and SVV but after opening of pleura fluid therapy was guided by delta SV with optimum SV and target SV (10% less than optimum SV) calculation. Six units of packed red cells, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma and 500 ml of 20% albumin was given along with 6 liters of crystalloids and low dose (<0.1 μg/kg/min) nor-adrenaline support was needed toward end of CRS phase. Urine output target during CRS was more than 0.5 ml/kg/h. Total peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) was 39 with completion cytoreduction score of 1. HITAC in form of adriamycin 15 mg/m2 and mitomycin 15 mg/m2 was given in left side of thorax with open diaphragm and whole abdomen for 60 minutes with help of Belmont pump. A urine output of more than 2 ml/kg/h was targeted during HITAC phase by use of cold fluids. Temperature control was done with cold fluids at 6°C and ice packs on neck and axilla. The maximum temperature reached was 37.8°C after 40 minutes of starting HITAC. ScvO2 at end of CRS was 75.6% and at the end of HITAC phase it was 83.4%. Serum lactates increased from 1.10 mmol/L at the end of CRS phase to 8.02 mmol/L at the end of 60 minutes HITAC phase. Peak airway pressure increased from 23 to 30 cm of H2O during HITAC phase. At the end of procedure loop ileostomy was done and diaphragm was closed, drains were put in abdomen and bilateral chest tubes were placed and abdomen was closed. The patient maintained a moderate metabolic acidosis of pH 7.2-7.3 throughout the HITAC. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) mechanically ventilated and sedated. In the ICU, she was electively ventilated for 48 hours. The trachea was extubated on high flow nasal oxygenation by Optiflow™. On postoperative day (POD) 1, parenteral nutrition was started. Adequate pain relief was achieved by epidural infusion of local anaesthetic for 4 days along with intravenous paracetamol 1 g 6 hourly. She was shifted out from ICU on POD 7.

A 26-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) with a one-day history of feeling unwell, nausea, and vomiting. She had previous ED visits where she was found to have multiple electrolyte disturbances as well as symptoms of intermittent abdominal pain and vomiting. Her past medical history also included a diagnosis of abdominal migraines after extensive investigation as well as a past history of eating disorder. Her regular medications included propranolol 80 mg daily, omeprazole 40 mg daily, prochlorperazine 3 mg twice a day, and haloperidol 0.5 mg three times a day for intermittent nausea. The general examination was unremarkable. At the time of her visit, she weighed 53.0 kg (body mass index (BMI) 21.5 kg/m2).
Investigations
Initial blood investigations revealed very low levels of multiple serum electrolytes with life-threatening hypokalemia. Urine investigations also revealed a low urine sodium level along with reduced urine osmolality (Table ). An electrocardiogram demonstrated life-threatening features in keeping with severe hypokalemia (Figure ).
Treatment
The patient was treated with intravenous potassium, phosphate, and magnesium in 0.9% sodium chloride solution while maintaining a 2 liter/day fluid restriction. Serum electrolytes returned to normal within 72 hours. She was discharged shortly afterwards with a short course of oral potassium.
Outcome and follow-up
The reason for her presentations remained undetermined because she denied excess fluid intake or a concurrent eating disorder. Historical results indicated chronic mild hypokalemia (range: 2.9-3.2 mmol/L) and hypochloremia (range: 67-94 mmol/L). Renin-aldosterone assay during normal potassium levels ruled out Conn’s syndrome. The patient’s serum electrolytes began to fall again but returned to normal after an overnight (12-hour) fluid fast. This confirmed reversibility of the patient's dyselectrolytemias (Table ).
After discussing the results, the patient admitted to drinking 4-6 liters of water a day to relieve intermittent abdominal pain. When severe, she would drink 6-8 liters of water within an hour. We discussed polydipsia and water intoxication and its detrimental effects on brain and cardiac function. The patient had no more admissions with electrolyte disturbance thereafter.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?

She did not have fever, appetite loss, night sweats, or dyspnea. Because of elevated liver enzymes and abdominal computed tomography (CT) abnormalities, including splenomegaly and multiple splenic tumors, she was referred to our hospital.
On admission, physical examination of the patient revealed the following: temperature, 36.3 °C; pulse rate, 84 beats per minute, regular; blood pressure, 132/74 mmHg; and respiration rate, 18 breaths per minute. Although she had remarkable anasarca, she seemed in no distress. Her height was 143.5 cm, body weight 71 kg, and body mass index 34.2. She had no jugular venous distention. Lymphadenopathy was not noted. No crackles were audible, but there were diminished breath sounds in the base of the right lung. She had remarkable nonpitting and slow pitting mixed edema of the legs. A delayed relaxation time of the Achilles tendon reflex was observed.
Laboratory test results revealed the following: white blood cell count, 7,400 cells/mm3; hemoglobin, 11.6 g/dL; platelet count, 103,000/μL; total protein, 6.0 g/dL; albumin, 2.9 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 27 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 20 IU/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 707 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase, 629 IU/L; total-bilirubin, 0.69 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 11 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.65 mg/dL; creatinine kinase, 15 IU/L; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 0.45 μU/mL (standard value: 0.45-3.33 μU/mL); free thyroxine (FT4), 0.37 ng/dL (standard value: 0.84-1.44 ng/dL); free triiodothyronine (FT3), 0.89 pg/mL (standard value: 2.11-3.51 pg/mL); and soluble interleukin-2 receptor, 6,660 U/mL (standard value: 124–466 U/mL). Urinary protein level was 0.2 g/g creatinine. A contrast-enhanced CT of the head, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed splenomegaly and multiple spleen tumors (Figure ), whereas there was no lymphadenopathy. CT-guided biopsy of the spleen was performed, which showed aggregated large atypical cells. The individual cells had the chromatin-rich nuclei and relatively abundant intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies (Figure ). Immunohistochemistry showed that the atypical cells were positive for CD20 and CD79a, and negative for CD3 and CD10. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry of the spleen led to the diagnosis of DLBCL.
We assessed the central hypothyroidism because of anasarca, delayed Achilles tendon reflex, and low FT4.
Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed swelling of pituitary gland, but a normal-size of pituitary gland was confirmed in a head MRI performed 1 year before (Figure a, b). Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were also at low levels (LH 0.3 mIU/mL [standard value: 6.7-38.0 mIU/mL] and FSH 3.4 mIU/mL [standard value: 26.2-113.3 mIU/mL]). Cortisol level was 21.6 μg/dL [standard value: 4.0-18.3μg/dL] and ACTH was 33.4 pg/mL [standard value: 7.2-63.3 pg/mL]. Prolactin was 9.2 ng/mL[standard value: 3.12-15.39 ng/mL(menopause women) ]. AVP level was not measured but there were no polyuria and hyponatremia. We diagnosed pituitary anterior lobe hormone insufficiency.
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed a localized accumulation in the pituitary gland, spleen, and para-abdominal aorta lymph nodes (Figure ). Pituitary gland biopsy was not performed; however, we clinically diagnosed central hypothyroidism caused by pituitary gland infiltration of DLBCL (clinical stage IV in the Ann Arbor staging classification).
She received 25 μg per day of levothyroxine for one week before the chemotherapy. However, the dose and duration of levothyroxine were not enough. The first course of chemotherapy for DLBCL including methotrexate, vincristine, ifosfamide, and dexamethasone, which improved anasarca remarkably and the patient’s body weight returned to what it was 3 months before. Moreover, thyroid hormone, LH, and FSH levels normalized and the pituitary gland swelling improved (Figure c), although thyroid hormone replacement therapy was not effective before chemotherapy (Figure ). We chose a second course of chemotherapy that comprised cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) because there were no atypical cells in the patient’s cerebrospinal fluid. This second course of chemotherapy led to remission and the same chemotherapy regimen was repeated.
Here, we describe a case of pituitary gland infiltration of DLBCL associated with central hypothyroidism, which caused remarkable anasarca. In this case, only a few clinical manifestation were anasarca and a delayed relaxation time of the Achilles tendon reflex, other than the typical symptoms of lymphoma (fever, night sweats, and weight loss).
Pituitary gland involvement as extranodal lymphoma is comparatively rare [,], and DLBCL is one of the most frequent histological types for pituitary gland involvement []. Infiltration of lymphoma cells to the pituitary gland lead to headache, opthalmoplegia, or hemianopia [], and often causes diabetes insipidus []. Anasarca is a rare symptom in patients with lymphoma [].
Moreover, lymphoma with pituitary gland infiltration seldom shows significant anasarca or weight gain caused by secondary central hypothyroidism. Some patients with lymphoma who have pituitary gland involvement have no symptom, and they are incidentally detected using PET or MRI []. We clinically diagnosed infiltration of a malignant lymphoma in the pituitary gland based on time-dependent changes in MRI findings, thyroid hormone, LH, and FSH levels before and after chemotherapy; and PET findings.
Infiltration of DLBCL cells to the pituitary gland caused secondary central hypothyroidism, and secondary central hypothyroidism led to anasarca and weight gain in our patient. Nonpitting edema was noted, provably caused by hypothyroidism, and slow pitting edema resulting from hypoalbuminemia was observed simultaneously.
Elderly people often have several disorders at the same time; however, we believe that, in explaining manifestations, one disorder should account for every symptom. In this case, the patient had remarkable anasarca because of DLBCL involvement of the pituitary gland. This case was very valuable because we could assess the patient’s abnormalities; that is to say, anasarca, weight gain, hypothyroidism, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase, splenomegaly, and swelling of the pituitary gland caused by malignant lymphoma and its infiltration into the pituitary gland.
In this era of longevity, the prevalence of diseases increases, and we must anticipate the greater likelihood of multiple, simultaneous diagnoses []. Hickam’s dictum and Occam’s razor are well suited to this case. “A patient can have as many diagnoses as he darn well pleases” []. This is Hickam’s dictum. However, William of Ockham stated “Among competing hypotheses, favor the simplest one” []. This is known as Occam’s razor.
It was easy to assess laboratory abnormalities, splenomegaly, and multiple spleen tumors that resulted from the malignant lymphoma. It was also easy to assess anasarca that was due to hypothyroidism and hypoalbuminemia. In this case, however, we reached the correct diagnosis of pituitary gland involvement from DLBCL, which manifested significant anasarca, according to Occam’s razor. A pituitary gland lesion with central hypothyroidism should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses of edema, especially nonpitting edema in some cases.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?

She noted that, over the past month, her skin appeared increasingly jaundiced, and she had been experiencing episodic upper abdominal swelling and discomfort. On presentation, she was visibly pale, with an unsteady gait and a reduced ability to focus, raising immediate concerns about the severity of her condition. Upon further interviewing, she revealed prior admissions for liver-related complications, including episodes of confusion likely linked to her underlying disease, but she did not recall needing repeated external filtration procedures in recent days. Examination at the bedside showed intermittent tachycardia, a blood pressure hovering at the lower limit of normal, and cool extremities suggestive of a possible low circulating volume. Palpation of her abdomen revealed tense swelling, consistent with fluid accumulation secondary to chronic portal hypertension, and she described resistance to typical diuretic medication regimens at home. She also reported that, in the months leading up to this admission, her alcohol intake had been oscillating between abstinence attempts and frequent binge episodes, which often ended in fatigue and abdominal pain. Inspection of her sclera revealed a prominent yellowish discoloration, affirming the history of worsening jaundice. She had developed several bruises on her forearms, possibly reflecting an inadequate clotting mechanism in the context of advanced liver dysfunction. Her mental status was compromised—she appeared disoriented to time and occasionally trailed off mid-sentence, but she remained aware that she had a significant bleed and required urgent medical assistance. Laboratory results at the time of this evaluation uncovered evidence of impaired clotting function, with an INR of 2.0, which was distinctly above normal and heightened her risk of ongoing bleeding. Further lab data revealed moderately reduced kidney performance, as demonstrated by a serum creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL, consistent with her reported decrease in urine output over recent days. She also displayed mild hyponatremia, reflected by a serum sodium of 133 mEq/L, adding to the overall picture of fluid and electrolyte imbalances typically observed in advanced cirrhosis. Her bilirubin concentration reached 2.2 mg/dL, aligning with the physical signs of jaundice and suggesting active hepatic injury. Throughout the interview, she lamented her inability to adhere to recommended dietary modifications, having forfeited regular meals once she began feeling persistently nauseated. She also felt her belly had become noticeably more distended in the days leading up to this emergency visit, describing a sense of fullness limiting her daily activities. Physical examination highlighted multiple vascular markings on her trunk, including small, spider-like formations indicative of chronic liver injury. Lung auscultation identified faint crackles at the bases, possibly due to fluid shifts or suboptimal ventilation in the setting of profound fatigue. Her overall presentation was consistent with acute gastrointestinal bleeding superimposed on advanced liver impairment, with both hemodynamic instability and significant coagulopathy dominating her immediate clinical picture. Imaging was arranged to assess for dilated vessels in her upper GI tract and rule out other acute abnormalities, though no interventions were initiated before the labs were drawn. She was placed under close monitoring in a high-acuity setting, with resuscitation measures begun concomitantly. Despite her confusion, she acknowledged the seriousness of her circumstances and expressed regret over missed opportunities to maintain sobriety or attend follow-up visits for her chronic condition. Her caregivers were promptly alerted, and a multidisciplinary team was readied to address both the urgent bleeding concern and the wide-reaching effects of her advanced disease. Given the severity of her hepatic dysfunction, her ongoing bleeding risk, and her compromised renal status, the next steps involved intensive observation, further diagnostic measures to identify the exact source of bleeding, and a careful approach to restoring hemodynamic stability, all while respecting the precarious balance her chronic condition demanded.

352,23,MELD Na (UNOS/OPTN),lab test,decimal,7,Synthetic,"A 48-year-old female with a longstanding history of excessive alcohol consumption and known cirrhosis presented to the hospital with acute onset of hematemesis and significant lightheadedness, having noticed a sudden, forceful episode of vomiting blood earlier in the day. She had been complaining of worsening fatigue, intermittent abdominal swelling, and increasing difficulty with her usual activities over the prior week, with her family noting that she appeared more jaundiced than usual and had been sleeping for longer stretches during the day. On arrival, she was alert but visibly distressed, complaining of persistent nausea and reporting dizziness upon attempting to stand. Vital signs revealed tachycardia and relatively low blood pressure, raising immediate concerns about volume depletion. Examination of her abdomen disclosed severe ascites and prominent venous patterns around her umbilicus. She also had a mild yellowish discoloration of the sclera, consistent with ongoing issues related to impaired hepatic function. In further discussions, the patient reported that, due to worsening fluid balance and related metabolic derangements, she had needed specialized external filtration sessions on more than one occasion over the preceding several days; she admitted that these episodes were arranged by her renal care team to manage her increasingly unstable electrolyte and fluid status. Further detail revealed that her medical history included multiple admissions for alcoholic liver inflammation and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which had previously been attributed to varices diagnosed during endoscopic evaluations. She even recollected having undergone procedures aimed at reducing portal venous pressure in the past, indicating that her portal hypertension had been a major source of complications. At this current visit, laboratory tests conducted soon after her arrival showed a modest elevation in her total bilirubin at 1.5 mg/dL, reflective of impaired hepatic clearance but not as severe as in some of her past events. Her kidney function assessment demonstrated a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, suggesting that, while her renal function was not dramatically compromised, there was sufficient concern to have warranted the recent interventions to help stabilize her fluid balance. Additionally, her sodium was measured in the 143 mEq/L, indicating that, at least at the time of this evaluation, she was not manifesting the hyponatremia that can sometimes accompany advanced cirrhosis, though she did complain of intermittent muscle cramps in her lower extremities. Of particular note, her coagulation studies revealed a marked prolongation of her clotting parameters, with an INR of 2.2, mirroring her repeated history of compromised synthetic function. From a clinical standpoint, the combination of her coagulopathy, the presence of tense ascites, and her ongoing high-risk drinking patterns created a precarious situation in which variceal bleeding could readily become life-threatening without prompt intervention. As the evaluating team arranged immediate gastroenterology consultation for endoscopic therapy, attention was also directed toward supporting her hemodynamic status and correcting her coagulopathy as appropriate. She continued to retch small amounts of blood-streaked fluid throughout her initial assessment, prompting additional measures to ensure airway protection. Despite her fatigue, she was oriented to her circumstances, though she required frequent redirection and reassurance. She remarked that her skin had become increasingly itchy over the past couple of weeks and that she had experienced sporadic dark urine, both of which had served as clues of advancing liver dysfunction from her perspective. Nevertheless, she had not sought timely medical attention previously due to reluctance to return for repeated hospitalization. Overall, her presentation at this point illustrated a classic pattern of advanced alcohol-related liver damage, including bleeding from the esophageal region likely exacerbated by the chronic pressure changes in her portal system, with lab findings indicating mild hyperbilirubinemia, moderate coagulation abnormalities, stable though at-risk kidney parameters, and balanced serum sodium, all occurring in the context of recent extra help in managing her renal and fluid status prior to admission.

342,23,MELD Na (UNOS/OPTN),lab test,decimal,pmc-3094288-1,Extracted,"A 17-year-old Caucasian female presented to local hospital with a history of acute alcohol intoxication and ingestion of large quantities of acetaminophen. The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.
Two days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.
Past medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.
Physical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.
Initial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.
At the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.
Renal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.
Physical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.
Renal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.
The patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively.

355,23,MELD Na (UNOS/OPTN),lab test,decimal,10,Synthetic,"A 60-year-old female with a long-standing history of advanced liver disease arrived at the hospital after experiencing multiple episodes of bright red hematemesis over the previous day, accompanied by progressive fatigue, reduced urine output, and a sense of bloating in her abdomen. She reported years of excessive alcohol consumption that culminated in cirrhosis, with evidence of portal hypertension identified in prior imaging and endoscopic evaluations. On questioning, she revealed that she had been feeling increasingly nauseated for several days, particularly in the mornings, making it difficult to maintain oral intake. She also noted that this was not the first time she had a bleeding episode, as she had experienced at least one major upper gastrointestinal bleed in the past that required urgent stabilization. Despite her worsening health, she mentioned never needing repeated sessions of external renal support in the week leading up to admission, nor being placed on any specialized prolonged therapy for kidney issues. Upon examination, her skin and sclera displayed a yellowish discoloration, and there were areas of ecchymosis on her arms, raising concern about coagulopathy and compromised liver function. She scored poorly on orientation to time, but she was still generally aware of her surroundings and recognized familiar individuals, suggesting a mild encephalopathy that had recently become more noticeable to her family. Her abdomen was notably protuberant, and percussion indicated the presence of shifting dullness as well as a fluid wave, both classic for ascites. She recalled that her urine output appeared diminished over the past week, though she could not quantify the exact amount. The patient’s heart rate hovered in the 90s, and her blood pressure was somewhat labile, but she was not profoundly hypotensive at initial assessment. Prior endoscopic evaluations had confirmed the presence of esophageal varices, which had been managed at various points with interventions aimed at reducing the risk of rebleeding. Laboratory results obtained at the time of this latest admission demonstrated marked derangements in multiple parameters relevant to her hepatic and renal condition. She was found to have impaired coagulation with an INR of 2.5, aligning with the widespread bruising noted on physical examination. Her kidney function tests showed a creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL, pointing toward a moderate reduction in filtration capacity, and she admitted experiencing episodes of decreased urine flow that aligned with this finding. Her total bilirubin was 2.5 mg/dL, highlighting compromised liver excretory function and aligning with her overt jaundice. Serum sodium was 136 mEq/L, neither profoundly low nor high, but consistent with the delicate electrolyte balance often seen in chronic liver disease. Imaging studies of her abdomen performed during this visit confirmed the presence of extensive fluid in the peritoneal cavity and provided no strong evidence of large clots occluding the portal or splenic veins. She did not exhibit signs of an acute infection, though further diagnostic tests were planned to exclude spontaneous bacterial peritonitis given her volume of ascites. The patient stated she had neither undergone ongoing extracorporeal clearance measures at home nor been connected to any continuous filtration apparatus for lengthy periods in recent days, and her outpatient records confirmed no recent reliance on such therapies. She mentioned prior episodes of confusion precipitated by elevated ammonia levels, which had sometimes necessitated adjustments in her medical regimen. Additional details in her history revealed that she had been advised to modify her alcohol use on multiple occasions, but full abstinence had been difficult to sustain. Despite past attempts at employing diverse medications to curb gastric acid output and reduce the likelihood of recurrent bleeding, she found herself once again in a critical situation with hemodynamic instability looming. Physical inspection also revealed mild pedal edema, though the more striking finding was the distended abdomen, which was tender but without obvious peritoneal signs. Initial resuscitative efforts focused on ensuring her airway was protected in case further vomiting episodes occurred and stabilizing her circulatory status. The clinical impression upon arrival suggested a dangerous flare of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage superimposed on a background of significant cirrhosis, placing her at risk for further complications. The plan moving forward included prompt assessment by endoscopy services and possible interventions to halt any active variceal bleeding. No acute treatments were administered before the lab values and clinical findings were recorded, reflecting her baseline status on presentation. She would require ongoing surveillance in a higher acuity setting to monitor for hemodynamic shifts, reaccumulation of fluid, or increasing mental status changes as her condition evolves.

When the emergency medical services team arrived on scene, the patient was found down on the floor with right leg weakness; he was confused and aphasic. No fumes or smoke was evident. Due to altered mental status, he was intubated and was subsequently transferred to our medical facility. Six hours after the incident, the patient was more alert and oriented and his leg pain had subsided. Details of smoking history could not be obtained due to the intubation. On physical examination, temperature was 35.8°C, heart rate 107 bpm, blood pressure 137/94 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 14 breaths/minute. He had regular heart rhythm, no murmur or pericardial rub. His abdomen was soft with active bowel sound. There were no symptoms and signs of limb ischemia on admission. He had no leg pain, pallor, poikilothermia, pulselessness, paresthesia, or paralysis. Motor power was at least grade 4 in all 4 extremities. His dorsalis pedis pulse was 2+ bilaterally. Initial investigations at our medical facility showed white blood cell 11400/µL, neutrophils 89%, hemoglobin 13.1 g/dL, hematocrit 38.6%, platelet 159000/µL, blood urea nitrogen 29 mg/dL, creatinine 2.0 mg/dL, sodium 142 mEq/L, potassium 3.9 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate 19 mEq/L, lactic acid 4.25 mmol/L, troponin T 0.1 ng/mL, and negative for acetone. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and no ST-T change. The liver function test demonstrated aspartate aminotransferase 1697 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 1263 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 138 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL, total protein 6.2 gm/dL, and albumin 3.5 mg/dL. Urinalysis showed white blood cell 5 to 10/high-power field, red blood cell 0 to 3/high-power field, moderate blood but negative for urine myoglobin. Coagulogram showed prothrombin time 17.5 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 25.8 seconds, and international normalized ratio 1.59. Calculated fractional excretion of sodium and urea were 2.11% and 43.67%, respectively, consistent with acute tubular necrosis. The viral hepatitis panel was negative except for a positive AntiHBc IgG antibody. Arterial blood gas analysis on admission depicted pH 7.319, PO2 130.3 mm Hg, PCO2 40.8 mm Hg, HCO3 20.5 mEq/L, and Sao2 100%, carboxyhemoglobin 0.2%, and methemoglobin 0.1% while on assist-control mode of mechanical ventilation with Fio2 100%. Computed tomography of head was performed and showed chronic right basal ganglion infarct. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed and showed severely depressed left ventricular function with ejection fraction of less than 20%, grade II/IV diastolic dysfunction with mild TR, mild MR, and mild PR. Akinesis of the septal wall and hypokinesis of the anterolateral wall were present. Moreover, computed tomography of abdomen, pelvis, and chest without contrast revealed right lower lung consolidation with small right pleural effusion, moderately bilateral nonspecific perinephric fat stranding, submucosal fatty infiltration, and mild wall thickening of the descending colon down to the rectum. Subtle perirectal fat stranding was also visualized. Initially, he was treated with empiric antibiotics for possible pneumonia with severe sepsis with piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, and vancomycin. Aspirin and full-dose enoxaparin were started to cover possible acute coronary syndrome. Surgery was consulted due to a concern of bowel ischemia. Proctoscopy was done and showed normal pink rectal mucosa without blood in the vault. Because the patient was hemodynamically stable, had no abdominal pain, and lactic acid level had returned to normal, the surgery service recommended continued fluid replacement for volume expansion.
His lactate levels decreased spontaneously from 15 mmol/L to 3.39, 2.52, and 1.28 mmol/L at 0, 10, 14, and 33 hours, respectively, after his initial symptoms, along with an improvement of arterial pH and anion gap (). After 24 hours of admission, he improved dramatically and was extubated on day 2 of admission. Five hours after extubation (42 hours after admission), he started to have left leg pain. His left leg turned bluish and became paler with prominent livedo reticularis throughout his left leg (). Therefore, a heparin drip was initiated promptly and vascular surgery was consulted. Soon after that, the patient developed sudden cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity. He had return of spontaneous circulation after 15 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. At that moment, his lactate level rebounded to 8.13 mmol/L. To rule out acute aortic dissection and acute massive pulmonary embolism as well as acute left limb gangrene from embolism, computed tomography of pulmonary artery with contrast and computed tomography angiogram of aorta were performed. He had no pulmonary emboli or abdominal aortic dissection. He did have high-grade stenosis of the infrarenal abdominal aorta just above the bifurcation, near total occlusion of the right common iliac artery, severe luminal narrowing of the left common iliac artery, bilateral external iliac arteries, and bilateral common femoral arteries by calcified and noncalcified plaques ( and ). Emergent revascularization was planned but the patient developed pulseless electrical activity/asystole again and passed away.",What is the patient's MELD Na score? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.,"{'creatinine': [2.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis for ≥24 hours in the past week': False, 'Dialysis at least twice in the past week': False, 'international normalized ratio': 1.59, 'Sodium': [142.0, 'mEq/L'], 'Bilirubin': [0.7, 'mg/dL']}",18.0,17.1,18.9,"The formula for computing the MELD Na is to first apply the following equation: MELD(i) = 0.957 x ln(Cr) + 0.378 x ln(bilirubin) + 1.120 x ln(INR) + 0.643.
If the MELD(i) is greater than 11 after rounding to the nearest tenth and multiplying the MELD(i) by 10, we apply the following equation: MELD = MELD(i) + 1.32 x (137 - Na) -  [ 0.033 x MELD(i) x (137 - Na)]. The MELD Na score is capped at 40. The concentration of Na is mEq/L, the concentration of bilirubin is mg/dL, and the concentration of creatinine is mg/dL. If the patient's Na concentration is less than 125 mEq/L, we set it to 125 mEq/L and if the patient's the Na concentration is greater 137 mEq/L, we round it to 137 mEq/L.
The concentration of creatinine is 2.0 mg/dL. 
The patient has not went through dialysis at least twice in the past week.
The patient is reported to not have done dialysis at least twice in the past week.
The concentration of bilirubin is 0.7 mg/dL. The patient's bilirubin concentration is less than 1.0 mg/dL, and so we set the bilirubin concentration to 1.0 mg/dL.
The patient's INR is 1.59. 
The concentration of sodium is 142.0 mEq/L. The sodium concentration is greater than 137 mEq/L, and so we set the sodium concentration to 137 mEq/L.
Applying the first equation gives us 0.957 x ln(2.0) + 0.378 x ln(1.0) + 1.120 x ln(1.59) + 0.643 = 1.8257239499758648. Rounding to the nearest tenth makes the MELD (i) score 1.8. We then multiply by 10, making the MELD(i) score 18.
Because the MELD (i) score is greater than 11, we then apply the second equation, giving us 18 + 1.32 x (137 - 137) -  [0.033 x 1.8257239499758648 x (137 - 137)] = 18.
The MELD Na score is less than 40, and so we keep the score as it is. The patient's MELDNa score, rounded to the nearest integer, is 18 points."

361,25,HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk,risk,integer,1,Synthetic,"A 72-year-old man was seen in the cardiology office after being referred by his primary clinician for reassessment of anticoagulation in the setting of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that was first documented five years ago during an emergency department visit for palpitations. He reports that his heart rhythm symptoms have been well controlled on metoprolol succinate 75 mg daily, and he has remained in sinus rhythm since a direct-current cardioversion performed six months earlier, but because of a recent episode of self-limited macroscopic hematuria his primary clinician requested a comprehensive review of factors that could influence bleeding risk. Today he describes no chest pain, dyspnea, focal neurologic complaints, or syncope. His blood pressure in the clinic, measured manually after five minutes of seated rest, is 168/92 mm Hg; he states that home readings are usually “in the 150s” despite adherence to lisinopril 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily. He has stage 3b chronic kidney disease attributed to hypertensive nephrosclerosis; baseline serum creatinine has fluctuated between 2.1 and 2.6 mg/dL over the past year, with the most recent value from last week at 2.4 mg/dL (eGFR approximately 28 mL/min/1.73 m²). He denies ever having been told of cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, or alcohol-related liver injury, and last month’s comprehensive metabolic panel showed AST 28 U/L, ALT 31 U/L, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL, and normal albumin. There is no personal history of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or intracranial hemorrhage, and he has never experienced retinal or spinal cord ischemic events. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with a drug-eluting stent in the mid-left anterior descending artery four years ago and has remained on aspirin 81 mg daily since that time; he takes naproxen 220 mg up to twice daily for lumbar osteoarthritis flare-ups, most recently two days ago after mowing his lawn. His other daily medications include warfarin (most recent INR 2.3), rosuvastatin 10 mg, and omeprazole 20 mg. He states he drinks two glasses of red wine on Friday and Saturday evenings, totalling 4 drinks per week, and otherwise denies liquor or beer consumption. He has never smoked cigarettes and quit chewing tobacco three decades ago. Family history is notable for a father who died of myocardial infarction at age 62 and a mother with age-related macular degeneration; no first-degree relatives have bleeding disorders. Review of systems is negative for melena, hematemesis, easy bruising, gingival bleeding, epistaxis, or abdominal tenderness. On examination he is alert and oriented, BMI 29 kg/m², pulse 68 bpm regular, respirations 16/min, and afebrile. Cardiovascular exam reveals normal S1 and S2 without murmurs or gallops; carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly, and there is no ascites. Extremities show no edema or petechiae; radial and dorsalis pedis pulses are intact. Neurologic exam is nonfocal with normal strength, sensation, and coordination. Laboratory data available from this morning include hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL, hematocrit 39 %, platelets 210 × 10⁹/L, BUN 48 mg/dL, sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.3 mmol/L, and INR pending. Urinalysis confirms trace protein and 5–10 red blood cells per high-power field without casts. An electrocardiogram obtained today shows normal sinus rhythm at 67 bpm, PR interval 180 ms, QRS 96 ms, QTc 430 ms, and no acute ischemic changes. A recent transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 %, mild concentric hypertrophy, and left atrial enlargement measuring 4.4 cm, with no valvular vegetations or thrombus. He wishes to continue living an active lifestyle that includes caring for his grandchildren, gardening, and walking the neighborhood three times weekly, and he asks specifically about the balance between reducing stroke risk and avoiding future bleeding episodes as his kidney function worsens.",What is the patient's HAS-BLED score?

369,25,HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk,risk,integer,7,Synthetic,"A 70-year-old woman came to the electrophysiology follow-up clinic at her referring internist’s request to re-evaluate long-term oral anticoagulation in the setting of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation that had first been identified on a routine pre-operative ECG sixteen months ago. Since that time she has been taking warfarin, but she relates considerable difficulty maintaining a steady anticoagulation intensity: during the past half-year her home INR log supplied by the anticoagulation service shows values swinging from 1.6 to 4.1 despite dose adjustments, and she recalls two telephone calls from the clinic instructing her to hold doses and repeat testing because the value was above the therapeutic window. She denies ever needing reversal agents, hospital admission, transfusion, endoscopy, or surgical intervention for hemorrhage, but she does remember a prolonged gingival ooze after a dental cleaning three months earlier and a self-limited superficial epistaxis episode after using a home humidifier in winter. She has never experienced black or bloody stools, hematemesis, hematuria, or bruising large enough to raise concern. Her medical history is otherwise notable for well-controlled type 2 diabetes managed with metformin 500 mg twice daily, dyslipidemia treated with atorvastatin 20 mg nightly, postmenopausal osteoporosis for which she takes weekly alendronate, seasonal allergic rhinitis controlled with nasal corticosteroid spray, and remote nicotine dependence; she smoked one pack per day for twenty years but quit fifteen years ago. She has never been told she has high blood pressure, and serial printouts from her community pharmacy’s automated cuff over the past year show systolic readings consistently in the 110s-120s mm Hg range, with today’s seated manual measurement 123/74 mm Hg and a heart rate of 78 beats per minute that is irregularly irregular. She denies transient ischemic attack, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, carotid disease, or peripheral embolic events. She has no personal history of chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcohol-related liver injury, or jaundice; a comprehensive metabolic panel drawn last week for her primary care visit documented AST 24 U/L, ALT 26 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 68 U/L, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, and albumin 4.2 g/dL. Kidney function has been unremarkable, with a stable creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL and estimated glomerular filtration rate of 68 mL/min/1.73 m²; she has never had nephrolithiasis, proteinuric disorders, or dialytic therapy. She is not taking antiplatelet agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or herbal supplements known to increase bleeding tendency; for episodic knee discomfort from old athletic injuries she uses acetaminophen 650 mg as needed, typically twice a week. She denies a family history of hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, aneurysms, or premature sudden death. Review of systems today is negative for chest pain, dyspnea at rest, exertional intolerance, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, abdominal pain, early satiety, pruritus, overt ascites, confusion, or peripheral edema. She remains physically active, walking her dog two miles most mornings and participating in low-impact aerobics at the community center. Socially she lives with her spouse and enjoys a nightly glass or two of white wine with dinner, plus a couple of champagne mimosas during Sunday brunch, amounting to roughly ten alcoholic drinks each week; she does not use recreational drugs and only drinks coffee otherwise. On examination she is well appearing with a body mass index of 26 kg/m², afebrile, and breathing comfortably. Cardiac auscultation reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops; jugular venous pressure is not elevated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, nontender, and without organomegaly or palpable masses. There is no scleral icterus, telangiectasia, spider nevi, palmar erythema, or digital clubbing. Extremities show no edema, petechiae, ecchymoses, or palpable purpura, and peripheral pulses are full and symmetric. Neurologic screening exam demonstrates intact cranial nerves, normal motor strength and tone, and no cerebellar signs. Laboratory tests drawn immediately before the visit reveal hemoglobin 13.4 g/dL, hematocrit 40%, platelets 232 × 10⁹/L, white blood cell count 6.1 × 10⁹/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.1 mmol/L, and INR 1.8. A twelve-lead electrocardiogram obtained in the office shows atrial fibrillation with an average ventricular rate of 76/min, normal QRS axis and duration, and no acute ST-T abnormalities. A transthoracic echocardiogram performed three months earlier indicated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, normal right ventricular size and function, mild left atrial enlargement, trivial mitral regurgitation, and no intracardiac thrombus. She expresses interest in learning whether continuing warfarin, switching to a direct oral anticoagulant, or considering rhythm control strategies would best balance her desire to avoid both stroke and future bleeding episodes as she plans international travel later this year.",What is the patient's HAS-BLED score?

378,25,HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk,risk,integer,22,Synthetic,"A 53-year-old man was seen in the subspecialty arrhythmia clinic to review his chronic oral anticoagulation in the setting of paroxysmal non-valvular atrial fibrillation detected eight months earlier during an urgent care visit for sudden palpitations. Four months before that arrhythmia was discovered, he experienced an embolic left parietal ischemic stroke documented on magnetic resonance imaging; a brief inpatient course of intravenous heparin was transitioned to warfarin at discharge, and he completed a structured rehabilitation program with full recovery of speech and motor function. Since initiation of warfarin his community pharmacy–based service has logged weekly international normalized ratios between 2.2 and 2.6 with no dose interruptions, vitamin K rescues, or emergency evaluations, yielding a calculated time in therapeutic range greater than 75 %. He brings printouts of the past twelve INR checks that confirm this consistency. The patient’s medical history is otherwise notable for biopsy-proven non-alcoholic steatohepatitis that evolved three years ago into compensated cirrhosis; the most recent comprehensive metabolic panel, drawn one week prior to today’s visit, demonstrated alanine aminotransferase 68 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 74 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 136 U/L, total bilirubin 1.9 mg/dL, albumin 3.4 g/dL, and international normalized ratio 2.4 on his usual dose, with platelet count 142 × 10⁹/L. He has never manifested ascites, encephalopathy, variceal hemorrhage, or peripheral edema, yet hepatology follows him semi-annually and he underwent screening upper endoscopy six months ago that showed only mild portal hypertensive gastropathy without varices. He denies any kidney problems, and outpatient laboratory records over the past year list serum creatinine values between 0.8 and 0.9 mg/dL with estimated glomerular filtration rates consistently above 90 mL/min/1.73 m². Home blood-pressure readings provided on his smartphone average 116/74 mm Hg, and today’s seated manual measurement after five minutes of rest is 118/72 mm Hg with a pulse that is irregularly irregular at 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate 14 per minute, temperature 36.7 °C, and oxygen saturation 97 % on ambient air. Because of the prior cerebrovascular event his neurologist added enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg daily for antiplatelet synergy, and for chronic right knee osteoarthritis he self-administers over-the-counter ibuprofen 400 mg two or three times per week, most recently yesterday after mowing the lawn. Mood disorder screening several years ago led to initiation of sertraline 50 mg each morning, a regimen he continues. He is otherwise not taking clopidogrel, dipyridamole, corticosteroids, herbal supplements, or over-the-counter preparations marketed for “natural blood thinning.” He works full-time as an accountant, swims three mornings per week, and lives with his spouse; they are childless. Social history reveals he stopped smoking cigarettes a decade ago after a 12-pack-year exposure and denies recreational drug use. Regarding alcohol, he candidly reports drinking two pints of craft beer after work on most weekdays and four or five mixed drinks while socializing on Saturday evenings, amounting to approximately 24 alcoholic beverages each week; he acknowledges occasional weekend binges in the past but states he now spaces consumption evenly.

365,25,HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk,risk,integer,4,Synthetic,"A 79-year-old male with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presents to the cardiology clinic for reassessment of his antithrombotic regimen after several recent episodes of rapid ventricular response managed in the emergency department. He was first diagnosed with atrial fibrillation eight years ago and was started on warfarin shortly thereafter. Over the past year, however, the anticoagulation clinic has documented wide fluctuations in his international normalized ratio, with several readings below 1.8 and occasional spikes above 4 despite stable dosing and diligent dietary counseling; these excursions prompted multiple dose adjustments and temporary withholding of the medication. Six months ago he was hospitalized for melena and symptomatic anemia secondary to a bleeding duodenal ulcer confirmed on endoscopy; he required two units of packed red blood cells but recovered without the need for surgical intervention. Since that admission he has had no recurrent gastrointestinal hemorrhage, yet he remains concerned about another bleed if warfarin is continued. His medical history is notable for three decades of systolic-predominant hypertension diagnosed in his late forties, treated with a long-acting calcium-channel blocker and an angiotensin-receptor blocker, although home blood-pressure logs provided today still demonstrate systolic values frequently running in the 150s mm Hg. He denies any prior cerebral ischemic or hemorrhagic events, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney pathology, or known hepatic disorders. He does not smoke and states that he consumes 0 alcoholic drinks per week, having abstained completely since his early seventies after the passing of his spouse. Review of systems is negative for jaundice, pruritus, abdominal distention, easy bruising, hematuria, or decreased urine output. Vital signs in clinic reveal blood pressure of 156/72 mm Hg, heart rate 92 beats/min with irregularly irregular rhythm, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, temperature 36.6 °C, and oxygen saturation 98 % on room air. Physical examination is notable for an audible S1 and variable S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, and no carotid bruits. Lungs are clear bilaterally. The abdomen is soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly. There is no peripheral edema or petechiae. Neurologic exam demonstrates intact cranial nerves II–XII, normal strength throughout, and no focal deficits. Recent laboratory studies from this morning show hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL, platelet count 210 × 10^3/µL, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL (estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73 m^2), aspartate aminotransferase 26 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 22 U/L, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, and albumin 4.1 g/dL. Baseline coagulation profile performed prior to resuming anticoagulation reveals an INR of 1.1. Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation with variable ventricular response and no acute ischemic changes. Transthoracic echocardiogram obtained two months ago documented a left atrial diameter of 4.9 cm, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 60 %, and no valvular vegetations or significant regurgitant lesions. The patient currently takes amlodipine 10 mg daily, losartan 100 mg daily, omeprazole 40 mg daily, and metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice daily; he discontinued non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs several years ago because of dyspepsia. He expresses a desire to understand his bleeding hazard relative to his stroke prevention benefit before deciding whether to continue warfarin, switch to a direct oral anticoagulant, or pursue rhythm-control strategies alone. The plan is to discuss individualized risk estimates, optimize blood-pressure control, and schedule closer INR monitoring should he elect to restart vitamin K antagonist therapy while awaiting shared decision-making.",What is the patient's HAS-BLED score?

377,25,HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk,risk,integer,13,Synthetic,"A 57-year-old woman arrived to the hospital-based anticoagulation management clinic for a scheduled evaluation of her long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy, which had been instituted sixteen months earlier after electrocardiographic confirmation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation discovered during an emergency department visit for palpitations and mild light-headedness. Since initiation of warfarin she has attended weekly or bi-weekly laboratory checks, yet despite diligent follow-up the anticoagulation service has documented marked swings in her international normalized ratio; printouts reviewed today demonstrate values dipping to 1.6 and soaring to 4.3 on several occasions over the past quarter, requiring alternating dose escalations, temporary holds, and two instances of oral vitamin K rescue, and her calculated time in therapeutic range is well below the recommended threshold. She has never required hospitalization, reversal with plasma, or transfusion, and she denies epistaxis, gingival oozing, gross hematuria, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or abnormal bruising. Her past medical history is noteworthy for a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction four years ago treated with a drug-eluting stent to the right coronary artery; consequently she has remained on low-dose aspirin 81 mg daily as secondary prevention. In addition, she manages chronic mechanical low-back pain with over-the-counter ibuprofen 400 mg up to three times per day during flares, most recently in the week prior to clinic because she helped her daughter move apartments. She does not carry a diagnosis of high blood pressure; serial outpatient readings furnished by her primary care physician and today’s measurement of 118/70 mm Hg confirm normotension, and she takes no antihypertensive agents. There is no personal history of transient ischemic attack, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial aneurysm, carotid artery disease, peripheral embolic events, peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, inherited bleeding diathesis, or chronic viral hepatitis. She has never noticed jaundice, pruritus, abdominal distention, confusion, or easy fatigability suggestive of hepatocellular dysfunction; a comprehensive metabolic panel obtained one month ago for routine surveillance showed alanine aminotransferase 22 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 25 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 72 U/L, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL, and albumin 4.3 g/dL, values consistent with preserved synthetic capacity. Her other long-standing conditions include well‐controlled hyperlipidemia on rosuvastatin 20 mg nightly and seasonal allergic rhinitis for which she uses intranasal corticosteroids as needed. She does not smoke and has never used recreational drugs. Regarding alcohol, she candidly reports enjoying two glasses of red wine with dinner on most weeknights and often sharing a couple of craft beers with friends on Saturdays, yielding an average of 11 alcoholic drinks per week; she denies binge episodes, hard liquor intake, or morning consumption. Family history is pertinent for premature coronary disease in her father but negative for hemorrhagic stroke, aneurysm, or clotting disorders. Review of systems today is negative for chest pain, new dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, change in bowel habits, focal weakness, vision changes, or sudden severe headache. She works as a middle school science teacher, walks two miles most mornings, and maintains independence in all activities of daily living. On examination she appears well nourished and in no distress, with body mass index 24 kg/m², temperature 36.8 °C, irregularly irregular pulse 86 beats/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and oxygen saturation 98 % on ambient air. Conjunctiva are pink, sclerae anicteric, oropharyngeal mucosa moist without petechiae, and neck supple without jugular venous distention. Cardiac auscultation reveals the expected variability in S1 intensity without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout. The abdomen is soft, nondistended, and non-tender with no palpable hepatosplenomegaly, shifting dullness, or caput medusae. Skin is warm without ecchymoses, purpura, spider angiomas, or palmar erythema; distal pulses are intact and there is no pedal edema. Neurologic screening shows normal mentation, intact cranial nerves, full motor strength, and normal coordination. Point-of-care INR obtained in clinic is 3.9, once again above her target range of 2.0–3.0. A complete blood count drawn simultaneously demonstrates hemoglobin 13.1 g/dL, hematocrit 39 %, and platelet count 245 × 10⁹/L, with normal indices. Electrocardiogram confirms atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response at 80 beats/min and no acute ischemic changes. She expresses concern about the difficulty maintaining stable anticoagulation and the cumulative effect of aspirin and intermittent ibuprofen on her risk of bleeding, yet she wishes to continue stroke prophylaxis given her understanding of the arrhythmia’s thromboembolic potential. The encounter focuses on education regarding limiting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, moderating alcohol intake, coordinating with her cardiologist to determine if she might transition to a direct oral anticoagulant once contraindications are excluded, and scheduling closer follow-up with the anticoagulation team to address dietary fluctuations that may be contributing to her variable INR.",What is the patient's HAS-BLED score?

His past history was remarkable for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), secondary polycythemia, pulmonary hypertension, and old pulmonary tuberculosis. He was maintained on salbutamol inhaler, fluticasone, and salmetrol discus inhaler, theophylline and home oxygen therapy. He denied receiving systemic corticosteroids in the preceding year. He was an ex-smoker and alcohol drinker. Physical examination on admission revealed an ill looking, dyspneic patient with a temperature 38.4°C, blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg, pulse rate 160/minute, and respiratory rate 36/minute. Chest examination revealed expiratory wheezes and bilateral basal crepitations. Otherwise, physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations revealed hemoglobin 13 mg/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) 14.6×109 /L (neutrophils 82%, lymphocytes 10%), platelets 25×109 /L, glucose 11.4 mmol/L, creatinine 135 mmol/L, sodium 129 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L. Arterial blood gases revealed pH 7.19, PCO2 74.8 mm Hg, PO2 96 mm Hg. Chest radiograph showed no lung infiltrates. Sputum culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, sensitive to cefipime and ciprofloxacin; however, it was thought to represent colonization. A diagnosis of COPD with acute exacerbation was made, for which he was given intravenous ceftriaxone 2 gm once daily, azithromycin 500 mg once daily, methylprednisolone 40 mg three times daily, and salbutamol and ipratropium bromide nebulizers. He made a gradual improvement, and after seven days he was shifted to oral prednisolone 40 mg once daily and oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid to complete two weeks of antibiotics. Prednisolone was given for a total of 13 days. Three weeks after admission he developed hemoptysis, chest tightness, and worsening cough. Sputum culture grew P aeruginosa for which he was given intravenous cefepime and ciprofloxacin. Sputum smear for acid fast bacilli (AFB) was negative. Because of worsening respiratory status and a chest radiograph showing an infiltrate involving the whole left lung and part of the right lung, bronchoscopy was performed on 27 January 2005. No endobronchial lesion was found. Antituberculous drugs in the form of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol were started. Bronchioalveolar lavage and bronchial wash were negative for AFB but bacterial culture grew P aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebisella pneumoniae. Cytologic examination of the bronchial wash and lavage revealed bronchial epithelial cells, few squamous cells in the background of numerous S stercoralis worms () and bacteria with inflammatory cells and blood. Transbronchial biopsy showed only intraalveolar hemorrhage with anthracotic pigments, but was negative for granuloma, viral inclusions, or malignancy. He was treated with oral ivermectin 12mg once daily. Two days later he complained of vomiting, lower abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and constipation. Physical examination revealed abdominal distention, lower abdominal tenderness, and sluggish bowel sounds. A plain radiograph of the abdomen revealed distended bowel loops but no air fluid levels. Lapratomy was done. The findings at surgery were a dilated jejunum and ileum filled with stool. Microscopic examination of the resected part of the ileum bowel revealed acute inflammation, mucosal hemorrhage, and focal ulceration with abundant S stercoralis larvae (Figures and ). Postoperatively, he was mechanically ventilated. His postoperative course was complicated by hypotension and multiorgan failure and he expired after two days.","What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration for hyperglycemia in terms of mEq/L?

The concentration of sodium is 129.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 129.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 129.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 129.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 129.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 129.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of glucose is 11.4 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 11.4 mmol. To convert 11.4 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 11.4 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.0114 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.0114 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 2.05382 g glucose. To convert 2.05382 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 2.05382 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 2053.82 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 2053.82 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 205.382 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 11.4 mmol glucose/L converts to 205.382 mg glucose/dL. 
Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 129.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (205.382 - 100) = 131.52917 mEq/L.

Blood gas analysis revealed pH: 7.26, pO2: 86 mmHg, and bicarbonate: 20.2 mmol/L. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) showed gas in the intrahepatic biliary ducts. No obstructive pathology was found to mesenteric blood flow on Doppler USG. CT without intravenous contrast was performed because of abnormal renal function tests. CT revealed gas near the stomach, among colon segments (pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, PSI) and intrahepatic biliary ducts in central and left hepatic lobe (hepatic portal venous gas, HPVG) (Figure , Figure , respectively).
The patient was referred to another hospital that had an intensive care unit and started conservative treatment with antibiotics and intravenous fluid. Twelve hours after treatment, his general condition did not improve and signs of diffused peritonitis were observed on abdominal examination. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy. Necrosis was found in the terminal ileum and the entire colon during laparotomy. Doppler USG detected low flow in the vessels supplying these necrotic segments. However, resection was decided due to necrosis of these segments. These necrotic intestinal segments were resected and an end-ileostomy was performed.

The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilator therapy. The ketoacidosis had improved with hydration and insulin therapy, but on the second day of hospitalization, diuretic-resistant pulmonary edema developed and continuous renal replacement therapy was started. Klebsiella pneumonia was identified in sputum cultures. After 8 days of treatment, the lung lesions had regressed (). The patient was finally moved to the general ward. However, on the 5th day in the general ward, he started complaining of vague abdominal pain. His pain had aggravated with severe tenderness. An erect abdominal X-ray showed gaseous distention of small bowel loops with suspicious stepladder sign, suggesting mechanical obstruction (). Subsequent abdominal CT suggested multiple perforation of the transverse colon with panperitonitis ().
An emergency laparotomy was performed. Necrotic intestines were observed from the distal ascending colon to the proximal transverse colon. Necrotic portions were resected and the Periodic Acid Schiff and Grocott's methenamine silver staining of the resected specimen showed septated fungal hyphae with acute angle branching, suggesting aspergillus species (). The patient was finally diagnosed with colonic IA. Intravenous liposomal amphotericin-B (3 mg/kg/day) was additionally administered for 35 days. He was discharged with oral voriconazole to treat his reported remaining, abdominal discomfort and mildly elevated CRP levels. Voriconazole was discontinued at a follow-up visit to the outpatient department 2 weeks after discharge when his abdominal discomfort had relieved and CRP levels normalized.","What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration for hyperglycemia in terms of mEq/L?

The concentration of sodium is 125.7 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 125.7 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 125.7 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 125.7 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed.

Physical exam was significant for moderate to severe respiratory distress, inspiratory stridor, and subcostal and intercostal retractions. Lungs were clear to auscultation. The patient was otherwise alert and oriented. Arterial blood gas showed pH 7.447, pCO2 39, pO2 197, and HCO3 27 on 60% FiO2. His initial metabolic panel was significant for sodium 104 mmol/L, potassium 2.6 mmol/L, chloride 66 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 5 mg/dL (baseline 20 mg/dL), and creatinine 0.6 mg/dL (baseline 1.0 mg/dL). Glucose was 165 mg/dL. Magnesium and phosphorus were 1.1 and 2.1 mg/dL, respectively. Serum uric acid was low at 2.7 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed no leukocytosis or anemia. Urinalysis had a specific gravity of 1.010, moderate blood, and 15-29 red blood cells. Urine electrolytes were notable for a sodium of 48 mmol/L and osmolality of 217 mOsm/kg. Serum osmolality was 215 mOsm/kg. Urine and serum toxicology were negative for any substances. Alcohol level was negative.
Due to concern for airway protection, the patient was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Initial chest x-ray held concern for infectious process, but antibiotics were stopped after infectious workup was negative. The patient was given two units of fresh-frozen plasma, famotidine, and Benadryl, and started on methylprednisolone 60 mg every six hours for angioedema. Lisinopril was held at this time. For his hyponatremia, the patient's labs were suspicious for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and a one-liter fluid restriction was initiated with nephrology consult. Thyroid and adrenal workup to rule out other causes of SIADH was unremarkable. A CT chest scan was done to evaluate for malignancy as a cause of SIADH, but did not demonstrate overt suspicious lung pathology (Figure ). The patient's hyponatremia appropriately corrected over the course of one week and was 130 mmol/L upon discharge. Lisinopril was discontinued and marked as an allergy for the patient.

Two months prior to presentation, the patient had undergone cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) placement for nonischemic cardiomyopathy and left bundle branch block with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35%. No operative complications were reported.
Vital signs were within normal limits (pulse: 84 beats per minute; blood pressure: 132/68 mmHg; temperature: 36.1°C; respiratory rate: 18; oxygen saturation: 94% on room air). Physical examination was significant only for bibasilar rales; no pericardial friction rub or elevated jugular venous pressure were appreciated, and there were no clinical signs or symptoms concerning for tamponade. Laboratory studies demonstrated hyponatremia (sodium: 123 mEq/L), hyperglycemia (glucose: 260 mg/dL), and normocytic anemia (hemoglobin: 11.0 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume: 86.7 fL). N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was elevated to 239 pg/mL, which was near the patient's baseline. Serum potassium, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed an atrial-paced ventricular rhythm consistent with prior pacemaker placement. Two-view chest radiography revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette, minimal bibasilar atelectasis, and appropriate placement of the pacemaker leads ().
The patient was started on a fluid restriction of 1500 milliliters per day for hyponatremia and suspected heart failure exacerbation. However, subsequent laboratory studies showed significant worsening of the hyponatremia; by the second hospital day, the patient's serum sodium had decreased from 123 to 119 mEq/L (corrected for hyperglycemia: 123 mEq/L). Further investigation revealed serum blood urea nitrogen of 12 mg/dl, serum glucose of 264 mg/dl, calculated serum osmolality of 256 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality of 310 mOsm/kg H2O, and urine sodium of 42 mEq/L. Hypothyroidism was ruled out with a thyroid-stimulating hormone of 2.340 μIU/mL.
An echocardiogram demonstrated a large circumferential pericardial effusion with right atrial collapse (). Left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated at 55% with normal diastolic function. Diastolic right ventricular collapse was absent. Echocardiographic features were consistent with early signs of cardiac tamponade. However, there were no clinical signs of tamponade and vital signs remained within normal limits.
An urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with removal of approximately 1200 milliliters of sanguineous fluid. A follow-up echocardiogram was obtained one day after the procedure and demonstrated complete resolution of the effusion (). Serum electrolytes were monitored and showed a gradual improvement of the hyponatremia; serum sodium had increased from 120 to 123 mEq/L on the first postoperative day and to 131 mEq within 36 hours of the procedure (). Calculated serum osmolality also increased to 278 mOsm/kg. Analysis of the pericardial fluid was negative for malignant cells and pathogens. Our patient's pericardial effusion was presumed to be secondary to his previous CRT-D placement. The patient was discharged home in stable condition on the third postoperative day. Outpatient follow-up four weeks later showed no recurrence of the pericardial effusion.","What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration for hyperglycemia in terms of mEq/L?

He also had no hematuria, weight loss, night sweats, evening rise of temperature or loss of appetite, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitation, limb edema, loose stools, jaundice, and abdominal distension. Bleeding was absent from other orifices. He had no history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiac diseases, and pulmonary tuberculosis in the past. He consumed 80 grams of alcohol per day for 15 years, but he did not smoke.
On examination, he was ill looking, conscious, and was well oriented to time place and person. He had pallor and was dehydrated. However, he had no icterus, clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. His pulse rate was 110 beats/minute, blood pressure was 80/60 mm of Hg, body temperature was 98°F (36.6°C), respiratory rate was 19 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation was 95% in room air. The digital rectal examination showed fresh blood over the examining finger and otherwise normal findings. Abdominal and cardiac examination was normal.
Laboratory investigations showed hemoglobin 10.8 g/dl and hematocrit 31.6%. The total leukocyte count was 11510/mm3, neutrophils were 78%, and platelet count was 291000/mm3. The prothrombin time was 14 seconds, and the International normalized ratio was 1.08. The albumin level in the blood was 2.4 gm/dl, and total protein was 6.1 gm/dl, total and direct bilirubin were 0.7 and 0.1 mg/dl in the blood. Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase level was 97 U/L and 114 U/L, respectively. HbA1C level in the blood was 7.2. The level of blood urea nitrogen (33 mg/dl), creatinine (1.1 mg/dl), sodium (132 mEq/l), and potassium (3.6 mEq/l) were within normal range. Traces of sugar and albumin (++) were present in the urine examination. The fecal occult blood was found in the stool. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not detected in sputum in the acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain.
The chest X-ray was normal. Ultrasonography (USG) of the abdomen and pelvis and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed normal findings. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan of chest and abdomen showed asymmetric circumferential thickening in the ileocaecal region with lobulated thickened caecum, soft-tissue stranding and necrotic mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and indeterminate lobule in the lung (). Colonoscopy showed multiple transverse ulcers with overlying exudates in terminal ileum and ascending and transverse colon. Histopathological examination of the ileum and colon showed patchy ulcers with exudates, granulation tissue, fibrosis, deep lymphoplasmocytic inflammation, and crypt regenerative changes with fibrinoid changes in scattered capillaries and venules and was inconclusive. However, gene XPERT was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
He was diagnosed with ileocaecal tuberculosis. The hemoglobin level dropped to 6.1 g/dl after two days of admission, and he had an episode of weakness associated with profuse sweating and rigor. Fluid resuscitation followed by two pints of whole blood transfusion was performed. After that, his hemoglobin was increased to 10.2 mg/dl. He was managed with four antitubercular drugs and showed significant improvement. Following this, he was discharged on oral antitubercular medications (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and pyridoxine) after 10 days of admission.

The laboratory disclosed normal renal function (creatinaemia 1.18 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen 40 mg/dL) and normal haemoglobin (12.9 g/dL). Urinalysis featured microscopic haematuria (150 erythrocytes/microlitre) and proteinuria of 3.59 g/day. Serum albumin was 3.4 g/dL, and there was evidence of high total cholesterol level (total cholesterol, 254 mg/dL). Serum protein electrophoresis, serum protein immunoelectrophoresis, hepatic function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were normal. Serology for lupus (antinuclear, anti-double strand deoxyribonucleic acid, anti-Smith, extractable nuclear and anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies) and vasculitis (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) as well as the search for cryoglobulins was negative. Rheumatoid factor was negative, and serum C3 and serum C4 were on the normal range. Serology for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and Lyme disease was also negative. Chest X-ray was normal. Renal ultrasound revealed normal-sized and normoechoic kidneys, normal differentiation, and no hydronephrosis. A kidney biopsy was performed, and revealed diffuse mesangial hypercellularity () and diffuse granular mesangial deposits of IgA (). According to these, the diagnosis of IgAN was established. She started oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), lisinopril (20 mg/day), losartan (50 mg/day) and simvastatin (20 mg/day). Six months later, she was asymptomatic, and no other episodes of scleritis occurred. Ophthalmological examination was normal.

402,27,Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS),risk,integer,pmc-8054800-1,Extracted,"A 35-year-old male presented with severe abdominal pain and vomiting for 3 days. There was no history of fever or jaundice in the past. He was chronic alcoholic; consuming 400–500 mL country liquor daily for the past 10 years. On examination, he was afebrile with a pulse rate of 124/min and blood pressure of 110/80 mmHg. He had pallor, icterus, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. The first differential diagnosis was alcoholic hepatitis and pancreatitis. Ryle's tube (RT) was inserted for gastric decompression. Initial management consisted of intravenous fluids, rabeprazole, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Investigations revealed the following: hemoglobin: 10 g/dl, white blood cell count 13,000/mm3, platelet count 210,000/mm3, serum bilirubin 6 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 4.2 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 242 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 188 U/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase 121 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 52 IU/L, serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen 30 mg/dl, serum amylase 189 U/L, serum lipase 490 U/L, and normal chest X-ray. Ultrasound (USG) abdomen showed hepatomegaly with increased echotexture and a bulky pancreas. CT scan abdomen showed diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with heterogeneous enhancement and shaggy contour, blurring of peripancreatic fat planes with fat stranding, thickening of fascial planes, and the presence of intraperitoneal fluid collections. While on supportive medical management, his hemoglobin dropped to 8 g/dl in the next 2 days. RT aspiration was clear. Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy was performed to identify the bleed source. UGI endoscopy showed no varices and no peptic ulcer, but oozing of fresh blood was identified from the ampulla of Vater []. As hemoglobin was low on admission also, the patient must have GI bleeding since the onset of acute pancreatitis. Computed tomography (CT) angiography identified aneurysms at the distal end of the splenic artery []. Continuous bleed from ruptured splenic artery aneurysm resulted in hemorrhagic shock. The patient was resuscitated with multiple units of packed red cell transfusions. In view of deteriorating general condition of the patient and suspected infected peripancreatic collection, open surgery was planned. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed for the ruptured splenic artery aneurysm. Pathological examination showed giant cell reaction surrounded by fibrosis nearby a polymorphonuclear infiltrate suggestive of acute inflammation in a setting of chronic pancreatitis. It also confirmed peripancreatic hematoma and splenic artery pseudoaneurysm communicating with the pancreatic duct consistent with hemosuccus pancreaticus (HP).

924,28,APACHE II Score,risk,integer,4,Synthetic,"A 72-year-old male with leukemia was brought to the hospital for urgent evaluation after experiencing several days of progressive fatigue, mild shortness of breath, and lower abdominal discomfort. He appeared mildly flushed on arrival, with a body temperature of 37.5°C and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Due to the concerning nature of his presentation, he was rapidly admitted to the intensive care unit and underwent prompt assessment. His initial blood pressure measurements showed systolic readings at 120 mm Hg and diastolic readings around 64 mm Hg. Further examination revealed that his heartbeat was regular, averaging approximately 88 beats per minute. He denied any recent episodes of confusion or altered sensorium, and his neurological evaluation was consistent with a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 that reflected full alertness. His arterial blood gas analysis indicated a pH of 7.42, suggesting no major acid-base disturbance at this time, although there remained a heightened concern for potential clinical changes given his risk profile. The fraction of inspired oxygen he required on admission was around 45%, and his measured partial pressure of oxygen was approximately 72 mm Hg, reported in the context of his ongoing respiratory complaints. Laboratory studies performed shortly after arrival showed a sodium concentration of 136 mEq/L and a potassium concentration of 4.3 mEq/L, which were within acceptable limits. However, his serum creatinine level was elevated at 1.8 mg/dL, necessitating careful monitoring of his renal function. Despite this elevated level, there was no immediate concern for acute kidney injury on top of this finding, and he did not manifest signs of significant fluid overload or severe acid-base derangements. His hematocrit was measured at 34%, which was slightly reduced but not acutely critical, and his white blood cell count reached around 12,800 per cubic millimeter, raising the possibility of an infectious or inflammatory process given his background and presenting symptoms. He maintained full orientation according to clinical observation, with preserved verbal and motor responses consistent with a normal level of alertness. Owing to the acuity of his presentation, he underwent an emergent exploratory procedure for a suspected intra-abdominal source of infection or complication, and he was closely observed in the postoperative and critical care setting because of his predisposition to severe infections. Prior medical history included issues that compromise his overall immune defense, so heightened surveillance and aggressive prophylactic measures were implemented. Throughout the initial hours after intervention, he received supportive care while monitoring his respiratory parameters and hemodynamic stability. Additional imaging was obtained to clarify the etiology of his symptoms, and cultures were taken to identify any possible pathogens. Discussion among the care team emphasized vigilance for potential complications, including careful fluid balance and reassessment of his renal parameters. As the hours progressed, he remained hemodynamically stable with no new signs of deteriorating consciousness, and his temperature remained near baseline without further fever spikes. Plans for ongoing management included tailored antimicrobial therapy once specific organisms were identified, potential adjustment of his oxygen requirements if his lung function changed, and continued evaluation of his creatinine level to ensure there was no worsening of renal status. Throughout his stay, detailed monitoring of his laboratory values and clinical status was prioritized, given his significant risk factors and the emergent nature of his presentation.",What is the patient's APACHE II score?,"{'History of severe organ failure or immunocompromise': True, 'age': [72, 'years'], 'Temperature': [37.5, 'degrees celsius'], 'pH': 7.42, 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [88, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [24, 'breaths per minute'], 'Sodium': [136, 'mEq/L'], 'Potassium': [4.3, 'mEq/L'], 'creatinine': [1.8, 'mg/dL'], 'Acute renal failure': False, 'Hematocrit': [34, '%'], 'White blood cell count': [12800, 'mm^3'], 'Glasgow Coma Score': 15, 'FiO2': [45, '%'], 'PaO2': [72, 'mm Hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [64, 'mm Hg'], 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [120, 'mm Hg'], 'Surgery Type': 'Emergency'}",12,12,12,"The criteria for the APACHE II Score are listed below:

The total APACHE II score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.
    
The patient's current APACHE II score is 0 points.
The patient is 72 years old. Because the patient's age is between 65 and 74, 5 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 5 = 5.
The patient is reported to have an organ failure of immunocompromise with a surgery type being classified as Emergency. The patient's surgery type is classified as 'Emergency' and so 5 points are added to the total, making the current total 5 + 5 = 10.
The patient's FiO2 percentage is 45%.
Because the patient's FiO₂ percentage is less than 50%, we need to examine the patient's partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's PaO₂ is 72 mm Hg. Because the patient's PaO₂ is greater than 70 mm Hg, we do not add any points to the total, keeping the current total at 10.
The patient's temperature is 37.5 degrees celsius. 
Because the patient's temperature is between 36 and 38.5 degrees celsius, no points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 10.
The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure) + 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 1/3 * 120 mm Hg + 2/3 * 64 mm Hg = 82.66667 mm Hg.
Hence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 82.66667 mm Hg.Because the patient's mean arterial pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The patient's heart rate is 88 beats per minute.
Because the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The patient's respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.
Because the patient's respiratory rate is between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The patient's pH is 7.42.
Because the patient's pH is between 7.33 and 7.49, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The concentration of sodium is 136 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 136 mEq. To convert from 136 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 136 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 136 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 136.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136 mEq sodium/L converts to 136.0 mmol sodium/L. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The concentration of potassium is 4.3 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of potassium from mEq to mmol. The mass of potassium is 4.3 mEq. To convert from 4.3 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 4.3 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 4.3 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 4.3 mmol potassium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.3 mEq potassium/L converts to 4.3 mmol potassium/L. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The concentration of creatinine is 1.8 mg/dL. The patient is determined to not have an acute renal failure.
The patient is determined to not have a chronic renal failure.
Because the patient's creatinine level is between 1.5 and 1.9 mg/dL (without acute renal failure), 2 points are added to the score, making the current total 10 + 2 = 12.
The patient has a hematocrit of 34%.
Because the patient's hematocrit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 12.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell count is 12800 count/mm^3. To convert 12800 count/mm^3 of white blood cell count to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 mm^3/L which will give 12800 white blood cell count count/mm^3 * 1000000.0 mm^3/L = 12800000000.0 white blood cell count count/L. Because the patient's white blood cell count is at least 3x10^9/L, but less than 15 x10^9/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 12.
The patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 15. For this criterion, we subtract 15 from the 15 points and add that to the total score. 15 - 15 = 0. Hence, we add 0 to the total making the current total 0 + 12 = 12.
Hence, the patient's APACHE II score is 12."
934,28,APACHE II Score,risk,integer,14,Synthetic,"A 74-year-old male was brought to the intensive care unit with a high fever, respiratory difficulty, and marked lethargy that raised immediate concerns about a serious ongoing process. He had a known vulnerability regarding his body’s defense mechanisms, placing him at risk for severe complications, and he had recently undergone an operative intervention that had been arranged in advance rather than on short notice, arriving in the ICU in the immediate postoperative period. His Glasgow Coma Score was calculated at 4. His family reported that he had been progressively more tired and confused over the previous day, culminating in an acute decline prompting emergency transport. Vital sign measurements at presentation showed a high body temperature of 39.2 °C, correlating with his flushed skin and possible infectious or inflammatory process. His pulse was recorded at about 89 beats per minute, relatively stable but concerning in the context of the other findings, and his respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute, reflecting an increased workload of breathing. Measurement of arterial pressures yielded a systolic reading of 128 mm Hg and diastolic of 71 mm Hg. Though these blood pressure indices did not indicate frank shock, they demanded close monitoring given his precarious clinical state. Blood tests drawn immediately revealed a serum sodium of 147 mEq/L and potassium of 4.8 mEq/L, suggesting that some electrolytes were at the higher end of normal ranges and warranting repeated checks to detect any further derangements. Of greater concern was the markedly elevated creatinine level measured at 2.6 mg/dL; this indicated a deterioration of renal function in the absence of any documented longstanding kidney disease. His hematocrit was reduced to 29 %, potentially reflecting either chronic anemia or an acute drop that might impair oxygen-carrying capacity and limit the body’s physiologic reserves. Further laboratory data showed that his total white blood cell population was around 10,400 cells/mm³, a mild elevation that could signal an infectious process or another inflammatory trigger. His arterial blood sample exhibited a pH of 7.46, suggesting a mild shift toward alkalinity or a compensated state that could change quickly depending on ongoing metabolic or respiratory stresses. On arrival, he was placed on a markedly increased FiO2 at 80 %, well above half of the inhaled air, to maintain adequate oxygenation. Despite this high supplemental oxygen, his calculated alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient was markedly elevated at about 220 mm Hg, indicating a significant impairment in gas exchange. Clinically, he appeared tachypneic and demonstrated labored inhalations, with accessory muscle recruitment evident on inspection. He had no documented history of chronically reduced kidney function, and conversations with relatives indicated that he had not faced kidney-related admissions in the past, suggesting a new onset for his current renal issue. Given his severe mental status changes, the team worried about the risk of airway compromise or inability to guard the airway should his neurologic function worsen. At the same time, care had to be taken to evaluate potential causes of his elevated temperature, which ranged beyond typical low-grade readings. Because of the level of sedation required to keep him comfortable and safe for further investigations, the team recognized the urgency in ruling out primary infections and other acute problems, particularly in light of his inherent predisposition to complications from infectious agents or organ insults. Plans were considered for imaging studies to identify possible sources of infection, bleeding, or other triggers for abrupt decompensation, while also evaluating for potential complications related to his recent surgery rather than planning any new operative procedure at that time. By the time he underwent initial laboratory and clinical evaluations, he remained in a state of severely impaired consciousness, and his breathing dynamics signaled the possibility of impending respiratory compromise if interventions were delayed. The clinical picture suggested a complex interplay of high fever, acute renal derangement, and disordered mentation, all superimposed on a background of increased susceptibility to severe illness. Ongoing discussions among the critical care team centered on stabilizing him hemodynamically, preventing further organ dysfunction, and determining whether additional operative management would be necessary after his recent elective procedure or whether more extensive stabilization measures needed to precede any further intervention. His condition at the bedside underscored the delicate balance of supporting his circulation, protecting against the risk of worsening kidney injury, and identifying any treatable source of fever. Despite the absence of a known chronic kidney process, the elevated creatinine on arrival emphasized the need for meticulous oversight, including repeated checks of his urine output and the potential for renal imaging if indicated. Throughout this initial assessment, it was evident that further deterioration in vital parameters could precipitate significant danger for a patient with such weakened baseline defenses, reinforcing the necessity of prompt diagnostics and possible interventions.",What is the patient's APACHE II score?,"{'History of severe organ failure or immunocompromise': True, 'age': [74, 'years'], 'Temperature': [39.2, 'degrees celsius'], 'pH': 7.46, 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [89, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [26, 'breaths per minute'], 'Sodium': [147, 'mEq/L'], 'Potassium': [4.8, 'mEq/L'], 'creatinine': [2.6, 'mg/dL'], 'Acute renal failure': True, 'Chronic renal failure': False, 'Hematocrit': [29, '%'], 'White blood cell count': [10400, 'mm^3'], 'Glasgow Coma Score': 4, 'FiO2': [80, '%'], 'A-a gradient': 220, 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [71, 'mm Hg'], 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [128, 'mm Hg'], 'Surgery Type': 'Elective'}",32,32,32,"The criteria for the APACHE II Score are listed below:

The total APACHE II score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.
    
The patient's current APACHE II score is 0 points.
The patient is 74 years old. Because the patient's age is between 65 and 74, 5 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 5 = 5.
The patient is reported to have an organ failure of immunocompromise with a surgery type being classified as Elective. The patient's surgery type is classified as 'Elective' and so 2 points are added to the total, making the current total 5 + 2 = 7.
The patient's FiO2 percentage is 80%.
Because the patient's FiO₂ percentage is 50% or greater, we need to examine the A-a gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a gradient is 220. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 200 and 349, we add 2 points to the total, making the current total 7 + 2 = 9.
The patient's temperature is 39.2 degrees celsius. 
Because the patient's temperature is between 39 and 41 degrees celsius, 3 points are added to the score, making the current total, 9 + 3 = 12.
The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure) + 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 1/3 * 128 mm Hg + 2/3 * 71 mm Hg = 90.0 mm Hg.
Hence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 90.0 mm Hg.Because the patient's mean arterial pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 12.
The patient's heart rate is 89 beats per minute.
Because the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 12.
The patient's respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute.
Because the patient's respiratory rate is between 25 and 34 breaths per minute, 1 point is added to the score, making the current total, 12 + 1 = 13.
The patient's pH is 7.46.
Because the patient's pH is between 7.33 and 7.49, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 13.
The concentration of sodium is 147 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 147 mEq. To convert from 147 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 147 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 147 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 147.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 147 mEq sodium/L converts to 147.0 mmol sodium/L. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 13.
The concentration of potassium is 4.8 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of potassium from mEq to mmol. The mass of potassium is 4.8 mEq. To convert from 4.8 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 4.8 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 4.8 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 4.8 mmol potassium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.8 mEq potassium/L converts to 4.8 mmol potassium/L. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 13.
The concentration of creatinine is 2.6 mg/dL. The patient is determined to have an acute renal failure.
The patient is determined to not have a chronic renal failure.
Because the patient has acute renal failure and a creatinine level between 2.0 and 3.5, 6 points are added to the score, making the current total 13 + 6 = 19.
The patient has a hematocrit of 29%.
Because the patient's hematocrit is between 20% and 30%, 2 points are added to the score, making the current total 19 + 2 = 21.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell count is 10400 count/mm^3. To convert 10400 count/mm^3 of white blood cell count to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 mm^3/L which will give 10400 white blood cell count count/mm^3 * 1000000.0 mm^3/L = 10400000000.0 white blood cell count count/L. Because the patient's white blood cell count is at least 3x10^9/L, but less than 15 x10^9/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 21.
The patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 4. For this criterion, we subtract 15 from the 4 points and add that to the total score. 15 - 4 = 11. Hence, we add 11 to the total making the current total 11 + 21 = 32.
Hence, the patient's APACHE II score is 32."
931,28,APACHE II Score,risk,integer,11,Synthetic,"A 70-year-old individual with a known vulnerability that compromises the body’s defenses was transferred to the intensive care unit from the emergency department following several days of general malaise, reduced appetite, and progressive confusion. A formal assessment revealed a Glasgow Coma Score of 5. The initial temperature measurement was 36.8°C, suggesting that fever was not contributing to the presentation at that point, and cardiovascular assessments showed a systolic pressure of 124 mm Hg coupled with a diastolic pressure of 69 mm Hg. The heart rate registered at approximately 84 beats per minute, reflecting a relatively stable rhythm, and the respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute with unlabored breathing, indicating no overt signs of increased respiratory effort at that time. Laboratory values painted a picture of mild deviations, including a serum sodium level of 144 mEq/L and a serum potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L, both of which were within broadly acceptable limits. Some degree of renal insufficiency prompted concern, as the serum creatinine measured of 2.0 mg/dL, indicative of acute renal failure. Hematologic findings offered further insight, with the hematocrit close to 41% and a white blood cell count of 11,400 per cubic millimeter, hinting at a mild elevation suggestive of possible infection or inflammation. Additional investigation into the acid-base status showed an arterial pH of 7.43, implying near-normal balance in the absence of overt metabolic or respiratory derangements. By the time the arterial blood gas was analyzed, the individual was breathing under ambient conditions, so the fraction of inspired oxygen was only that found in room air at 21%. Despite the minimal external respiratory support, the arterial oxygen tension held steady at 75 mm Hg, which did not raise concern for significant gas-exchange impairment. Nonetheless, the patient’s dangerously decreased awareness level raised alarms, as the mental status evaluation suggested a pattern of profound disorientation and an inability to communicate consistently. This profound alteration was a striking feature, especially in a setting where defenses against infections or other stressors are suspected to be less robust than normal. Although the admission was prompted by concerns of rapid clinical decline in the context of immune vulnerability, there was no intention to undertake a procedure that involved opening a body cavity or relying on invasive operative strategies; rather, the approach at this juncture was to evaluate comprehensively for potential sources of deterioration, to stabilize organ function, and to ensure that any significant complications, whether infectious or inflammatory, were addressed immediately. Prior to this episode, the patient had not been known to have chronic dysfunction of the kidneys, and there were no records of frequent hemodialysis or an ongoing requirement for renal replacement therapies. Close neurological observation was carried out, considering the low responsiveness that placed the individual at a high risk for airway compromise and other complications unless carefully managed. Subsequent imaging studies, blood cultures, and specialist consultations were all under consideration as part of the initial workup. The decision to refrain from pursuing any invasive surgical route was based on the patient’s background, the lack of localizing signs that would point to a lesion needing operative intervention, and the immediate need to focus on controlling possible infection, ensuring stable hemodynamics, and improving the severely impaired level of consciousness. Throughout the assessment process, there was an emphasis on vigilant monitoring of vital signs, periodic reevaluation of the patient’s neuro status, and stringent hygienic measures to guard against hospital-acquired complications, especially given the compromised state of the immune system. All these findings reflected the patient’s baseline condition upon presentation, well before any targeted therapies or advanced interventions had been initiated, underscoring the importance of timely evaluation and ongoing supportive care for an individual whose physiologic reserves might be less capable of containing even minor insults without rapid deterioration.",What is the patient's APACHE II score?,"{'History of severe organ failure or immunocompromise': True, 'age': [70, 'years'], 'Temperature': [36.8, 'degrees celsius'], 'Mean arterial pressure': [83, 'mm Hg'], 'pH': 7.43, 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [84, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [14, 'breaths per minute'], 'Sodium': [144, 'mEq/L'], 'Potassium': [4.6, 'mEq/L'], 'creatinine': [2.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Chronic renal failure': False, 'Hematocrit': [41, '%'], 'White blood cell count': [11400, 'mm^3'], 'Glasgow Coma Score': 5, 'FiO2': [21, '%'], 'PaO2': [75, 'mm Hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [69, 'mm Hg'], 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [124, 'mm Hg'], 'Surgery Type': 'Nonoperative', 'Acute renal failure': True}",26,26,26,"The criteria for the APACHE II Score are listed below:

The total APACHE II score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.
    
The patient's current APACHE II score is 0 points.
The patient is 70 years old. Because the patient's age is between 65 and 74, 5 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 5 = 5.
The patient is reported to have an organ failure of immunocompromise with a surgery type being classified as Nonoperative. The patient's surgery type is classified as 'Nonoperative' and so 5 points are added to the total, making the current total 5 + 5 = 10.
The patient's FiO2 percentage is 21%.
Because the patient's FiO₂ percentage is less than 50%, we need to examine the patient's partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's PaO₂ is 75 mm Hg. Because the patient's PaO₂ is greater than 70 mm Hg, we do not add any points to the total, keeping the current total at 10.
The patient's temperature is 36.8 degrees celsius. 
Because the patient's temperature is between 36 and 38.5 degrees celsius, no points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 10.
The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure) + 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 1/3 * 124 mm Hg + 2/3 * 69 mm Hg = 87.33333 mm Hg.
Hence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 87.33333 mm Hg.Because the patient's mean arterial pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The patient's heart rate is 84 beats per minute.
Because the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The patient's respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute.
Because the patient's respiratory rate is between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The patient's pH is 7.43.
Because the patient's pH is between 7.33 and 7.49, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The concentration of sodium is 144 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 144 mEq. To convert from 144 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 144 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 144 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 144.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 144 mEq sodium/L converts to 144.0 mmol sodium/L. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The concentration of potassium is 4.6 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of potassium from mEq to mmol. The mass of potassium is 4.6 mEq. To convert from 4.6 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 4.6 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 4.6 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 4.6 mmol potassium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.6 mEq potassium/L converts to 4.6 mmol potassium/L. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The concentration of creatinine is 2.0 mg/dL. The patient is determined to have an acute renal failure.
The patient is determined to not have a chronic renal failure.
Because the patient has acute renal failure and a creatinine level between 2.0 and 3.5, 6 points are added to the score, making the current total 10 + 6 = 16.
The patient has a hematocrit of 41%.
Because the patient's hematocrit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 16.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell count is 11400 count/mm^3. To convert 11400 count/mm^3 of white blood cell count to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 mm^3/L which will give 11400 white blood cell count count/mm^3 * 1000000.0 mm^3/L = 11400000000.0 white blood cell count count/L. Because the patient's white blood cell count is at least 3x10^9/L, but less than 15 x10^9/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 16.
The patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 5. For this criterion, we subtract 15 from the 5 points and add that to the total score. 15 - 5 = 10. Hence, we add 10 to the total making the current total 10 + 16 = 26.
Hence, the patient's APACHE II score is 26."
926,28,APACHE II Score,risk,integer,6,Synthetic,"A 77-year-old female arrived in the intensive care unit with a high fever and concerning changes in mental status. She had experienced a sudden onset of chills the previous evening, and by the time she was evaluated, her temperature had risen to 39.0 degrees Celsius. Blood pressure readings showed a systolic measurement of 115 mm Hg with a diastolic of 62 mm Hg. Although her pulse was not remarkably elevated at 92 beats per minute, she did exhibit some irregularities in her breathing pattern and was found to have a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Her oxygen requirements had increased significantly, with an inspired oxygen concentration of 55%, higher than one might expect in a standard clinical scenario. Laboratory tests revealed a markedly widened alveolar–arterial oxygen difference measured at 180 mm Hg, pointing to significant compromise in her respiratory function and prompting closer monitoring. Additional lab work showed normal serum sodium at 140 mEq/L and a potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, suggesting that her electrolytes were relatively balanced save for a newly noted rise in her kidney-related markers. Specifically, her creatinine measured 2.2 mg/dL, signaling a recent decline in renal clearance that was not previously documented in her records and suggesting an abrupt change rather than a long-established abnormality. She also had a white blood cell count of 11,500 per cubic millimeter, indicating a probable inflammatory or infectious process. Hematocrit was measured at 37%, which was slightly lower than her personal baseline but not alarmingly so. When assessed for neurological function, she showed signs of confusion and a diminished capacity to follow commands, consistent with a GCS score of 11. This was a notable drop from her previously reported orientation level, as she had been described by her family as independently functioning with no significant cognitive deficits just days prior. Her arterial blood gas analysis indicated a pH of 7.35, which was on the lower side of normal but still within a tolerable range, obliging the clinical team to keep a close watch on her acid-base status to ensure it did not worsen over time. She had no clear history of conditions that severely compromise immune function, and based on her current presentation, there was no evidence that she was in a postoperative state. Despite her advanced age, she had not undergone any significant procedure in the recent past that might have influenced her immediate condition. The sudden nature of her renal issues, in the context of her fever and infection markers, raised concern for an acute process placing further strain on her kidneys. She did not mention any previous longstanding diagnosis of kidney disease, and her prior medical records lacked any indication of a chronic decline in renal function. At the time of initial ICU evaluation, her decreased alertness and the rise in markers of infection were the primary focus, with close attention to her respiratory status given her high oxygen requirement and significant oxygen gradient. The team planned to proceed with a thorough infectious workup, including blood cultures and imaging, while closely following her hemodynamic parameters, ensuring that any adjustments to supportive measures would be guided by her kidney function, mental status, and laboratory trends in the coming hours.",What is the patient's APACHE II score?,"{'History of severe organ failure or immunocompromise': False, 'age': [77, 'years'], 'Temperature': [39.0, 'degrees celsius'], 'pH': 7.35, 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [92, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [16, 'breaths per minute'], 'Sodium': [140, 'mEq/L'], 'Potassium': [4.0, 'mEq/L'], 'creatinine': [2.2, 'mg/dL'], 'Acute renal failure': True, 'Hematocrit': [37, '%'], 'White blood cell count': [11500, 'mm^3'], 'Glasgow Coma Score': 11, 'FiO2': [55, '%'], 'A-a gradient': 180, 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [62, 'mm Hg'], 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [115, 'mm Hg'], 'Chronic renal failure': False}",19,19,19,"The criteria for the APACHE II Score are listed below:

The total APACHE II score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.
    
The patient's current APACHE II score is 0 points.
The patient is 77 years old. Because the patient's age is at least 75 years, 6 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 6 = 6.
The patient is reported to not have any organ failure immunocompromise and so 0 points are added to the total, keeping the total at 6 points.
The patient's FiO2 percentage is 55%.
Because the patient's FiO₂ percentage is 50% or greater, we need to examine the A-a gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a gradient is 180. Because the patient's A-a gradient is less than 200, we do not add any points to the total, keeping the current total at 6.
The patient's temperature is 39.0 degrees celsius. 
Because the patient's temperature is between 39 and 41 degrees celsius, 3 points are added to the score, making the current total, 6 + 3 = 9.
The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure) + 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 1/3 * 115 mm Hg + 2/3 * 62 mm Hg = 79.66667 mm Hg.
Hence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 79.66667 mm Hg.Because the patient's mean arterial pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.
The patient's heart rate is 92 beats per minute.
Because the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.
The patient's respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute.
Because the patient's respiratory rate is between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.
The patient's pH is 7.35.
Because the patient's pH is between 7.33 and 7.49, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.
The concentration of sodium is 140 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 140 mEq. To convert from 140 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 140 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 140 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 140.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140 mEq sodium/L converts to 140.0 mmol sodium/L. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.
The concentration of potassium is 4.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of potassium from mEq to mmol. The mass of potassium is 4.0 mEq. To convert from 4.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 4.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 4.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 4.0 mmol potassium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.0 mEq potassium/L converts to 4.0 mmol potassium/L. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.
The concentration of creatinine is 2.2 mg/dL. The patient is determined to have an acute renal failure.
The patient is determined to not have a chronic renal failure.
Because the patient has acute renal failure and a creatinine level between 2.0 and 3.5, 6 points are added to the score, making the current total 9 + 6 = 15.
The patient has a hematocrit of 37%.
Because the patient's hematocrit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 15.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell count is 11500 count/mm^3. To convert 11500 count/mm^3 of white blood cell count to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 mm^3/L which will give 11500 white blood cell count count/mm^3 * 1000000.0 mm^3/L = 11500000000.0 white blood cell count count/L. Because the patient's white blood cell count is at least 3x10^9/L, but less than 15 x10^9/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 15.
The patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 11. For this criterion, we subtract 15 from the 11 points and add that to the total score. 15 - 11 = 4. Hence, we add 4 to the total making the current total 4 + 15 = 19.
Hence, the patient's APACHE II score is 19."
936,28,APACHE II Score,risk,integer,16,Synthetic,"A 56-year-old male arrived at the intensive care setting after experiencing several days of progressive fatigue, occasional bouts of dizziness, and a noticeable rise in his body temperature by the time he became acutely unwell. On initial evaluation—before any interventions—he was found to have a moderately elevated heart rate at 99 beats per minute, and he was breathing at a notably rapid pace of 29 breaths per minute, suggesting increased respiratory effort likely related to both his febrile state and underlying physiological stress. In fact, his core temperature was measured at 38.5 °C, indicative of a fever that raised immediate concern for an infectious or inflammatory etiology. The blood pressure measurements revealed a systolic value of 126 mm Hg with a diastolic reading of 73 mm Hg. From a laboratory standpoint, he displayed a high serum sodium concentration of 149 mEq/L, a potentially relevant finding given the possibility of relative volume contraction or altered fluid balance, and his serum potassium measured 4.9 mEq/L, an upper-range figure that required vigilant monitoring. Additional basic metabolic tests showed a creatinine value of 2.7 mg/dL, which was consistent with his known chronic kidney disease and not felt to represent a new acute kidney injury, as he reported having struggled with declining renal function for an extended period rather than experiencing any abrupt worsening in this regard. Further pointing away from a sudden deterioration, he denied major changes in his urine output over the previous day and indicated that his nephrologist had long been aware of his compromised status, with no evidence of an acute renal insult or recent shift from his usual baseline. He did, however, exhibit signs of anemia, with a hematocrit measured at 28 %, prompting questions about potential chronicity in his reduced hematologic reserve. Frontline laboratory data further showed that his white blood cell count stood at 11,200 per cubic millimeter, slightly higher than normal and possibly reflecting an early immune response to an occult infectious or inflammatory trigger. Arterial blood sampling revealed a pH of 7.41, near the center of the normal range, indicating that acid–base status had not yet veered into overt disturbance, even though his respiratory pattern suggested the potential for developing changes if his rate continued to escalate. Simultaneously, his arterial oxygen tension was at 72 mm Hg while he was receiving a moderate level of supplemental oxygen—roughly just over one-third of the inspired mixture (FiO₂ 36 %)—which was sufficient to maintain reasonable saturation in spite of his labored breathing. His Glasgow Coma Score was calculated at 14 on the standard 15-point scale. Notably, he had a history of long-term kidney dysfunction characterized by consistently high creatinine readings, and his current value was in keeping with this chronic baseline rather than suggesting acute renal failure. Although he reported some transient episodes of fatigue and fluid retention over the years, there was no clear evidence to suggest that he had recently encountered a brand-new renal insult requiring emergent dialysis or additional renal support measures at this point. Despite his formidable fatigue, he remained strong enough to communicate, which aided the team in discerning the timeline of his symptoms, and he stated that he had never been told that his overall immune defenses were compromised in a way that would severely raise his risk for opportunistic conditions. Nevertheless, he did have some other risk factors and ongoing conditions that clinicians feared might compound the situation if his current febrile illness or presumed infection required aggressive intervention. Given his heightened respiratory rate and the possibility of progressive deterioration, he was placed under close surveillance in the immediate postoperative period after an urgent procedure that had been performed earlier the same day, rather than awaiting a future operation. At the time of admission, he was mildly sweaty, complaining of persistent chills, and describing diffuse muscle aches that intensified over the past twenty-four hours. Staff kept careful watch on his cardiac rhythm, noting that although his pulse was slightly below triple digits initially, it trended upward intermittently when he shifted in bed. He was not yet receiving vasoactive medications or intravenous antibiotics, as the final source of his symptoms remained unclear and required further diagnostic imaging and culture data for clarification. Despite the uncertainty, the presence of fever, abnormal blood studies, chronic advanced kidney impairment with a high baseline creatinine, and a moderately elevated respiratory drive collectively underscored the severity of his presentation. His older age and precarious renal function also meant he was at increased risk for fluid imbalances and electrolyte swings, both of which merited meticulous oversight prior to any definitive operative management. Should an urgent procedure become inevitable to address complications such as an intra-abdominal source of infection or another emergent condition, the team was prepared to coordinate with surgical colleagues promptly. For the moment, he remained alert enough to provide further medical history, reinforce the timeline of his symptoms, and cooperate with bedside testing, all while showing stable but potentially tenuous vital parameters that required immediate and continuous observation in the intensive care environment.",What is the patient's APACHE II score?,"{'History of severe organ failure or immunocompromise': False, 'age': [56, 'years'], 'Temperature': [38.5, 'degrees celsius'], 'pH': 7.41, 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [99, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [29, 'breaths per minute'], 'Sodium': [149, 'mEq/L'], 'Potassium': [4.9, 'mEq/L'], 'creatinine': [2.7, 'mg/dL'], 'Acute renal failure': False, 'Chronic renal failure': True, 'Hematocrit': [28, '%'], 'White blood cell count': [11200, 'mm^3'], 'Glasgow Coma Score': 14, 'FiO2': [36, '%'], 'PaO2': [72, 'mm Hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [73, 'mm Hg'], 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [126, 'mm Hg']}",11,11,11,"The criteria for the APACHE II Score are listed below:

The total APACHE II score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.
    
The patient's current APACHE II score is 0 points.
The patient is 56 years old. Because the patient's age is between 55 and 64, 3 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 3 = 3.
The patient is reported to not have any organ failure immunocompromise and so 0 points are added to the total, keeping the total at 3 points.
The patient's FiO2 percentage is 36%.
Because the patient's FiO₂ percentage is less than 50%, we need to examine the patient's partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's PaO₂ is 72 mm Hg. Because the patient's PaO₂ is greater than 70 mm Hg, we do not add any points to the total, keeping the current total at 3.
The patient's temperature is 38.5 degrees celsius. 
Because the patient's temperature is between 38.5 and 39 degrees celsius, 1 point is added to the score, making the current total, 3 + 1 = 4.
The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure) + 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 1/3 * 126 mm Hg + 2/3 * 73 mm Hg = 90.66667 mm Hg.
Hence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 90.66667 mm Hg.Because the patient's mean arterial pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 4.
The patient's heart rate is 99 beats per minute.
Because the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 4.
The patient's respiratory rate is 29 breaths per minute.
Because the patient's respiratory rate is between 25 and 34 breaths per minute, 1 point is added to the score, making the current total, 4 + 1 = 5.
The patient's pH is 7.41.
Because the patient's pH is between 7.33 and 7.49, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 5.
The concentration of sodium is 149 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 149 mEq. To convert from 149 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 149 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 149 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 149.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 149 mEq sodium/L converts to 149.0 mmol sodium/L. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 5.
The concentration of potassium is 4.9 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of potassium from mEq to mmol. The mass of potassium is 4.9 mEq. To convert from 4.9 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 4.9 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 4.9 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 4.9 mmol potassium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.9 mEq potassium/L converts to 4.9 mmol potassium/L. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 5.
The concentration of creatinine is 2.7 mg/dL. The patient is determined to not have an acute renal failure.
The patient is determined to have a chronic renal failure.
Because the patient has chronic renal failure and a creatinine level between 2.0 and 3.5, 3 points are added to the score, making the current total 5 + 3 = 8.
The patient has a hematocrit of 28%.
Because the patient's hematocrit is between 20% and 30%, 2 points are added to the score, making the current total 8 + 2 = 10.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell count is 11200 count/mm^3. To convert 11200 count/mm^3 of white blood cell count to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 mm^3/L which will give 11200 white blood cell count count/mm^3 * 1000000.0 mm^3/L = 11200000000.0 white blood cell count count/L. Because the patient's white blood cell count is at least 3x10^9/L, but less than 15 x10^9/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 14. For this criterion, we subtract 15 from the 14 points and add that to the total score. 15 - 14 = 1. Hence, we add 1 to the total making the current total 1 + 10 = 11.
Hence, the patient's APACHE II score is 11."
898,29,PSI Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP,severity,integer,18,Synthetic,"A 75-year-old female arrived at the emergency department describing four days of progressive respiratory discomfort that worsened considerably in the last 24 hours. She reported having felt slightly chilled on and off, yet only noted a mild elevation in her temperature when she checked it at home, which was confirmed on arrival as moderately above her usual baseline, though not strikingly high at 37.6 degrees Celsius. She indicated that her coughing, which began as an intermittent irritation, gradually intensified and was now accompanied by minimal sputum production. Though she did not appear confused or disoriented during the interview, she mentioned being more fatigued than usual, finding simple household activities taxing. She has resided independently for many years, taking care of her daily needs without ongoing assistance, and specifically noted living in her own house rather than a supervised environment. She claimed no further limitations except for occasionally reduced stamina related to a neurological event in her past, which she said caused transient weakness and difficulty with coordination several years earlier. According to her recollection, careful management and rehabilitation helped her regain much of her functionality, but she still routinely follows up with her physician to ensure there are no late complications. She also recalled a longstanding concern involving her liver that once led her to attend specialized evaluations, though she did not elaborate extensively on the details aside from stating that she has to be mindful of potential side effects when prescribed new medications. She denied significant cardiac difficulties that would require regular attention for fluid management and has experienced no episodes of fluid accumulation in her extremities or lungs that might point to a chronic heart condition; she insisted her heart rate fluctuations are typically mild. On examination, she was alert, cooperative, and oriented to time, place, and situation, with no lapse in her current mental clarity. Her breathing, however, caught the attention of the clinical team, given that her rate of inspirations was measured at 15 per minute, which was within an acceptable range but did not match the degree of subjective discomfort she reported. Her pulse was notably elevated at 105 beats per minute, though its rhythm was regular. Documentation of her systolic blood pressure revealed a value of 114 mm Hg, consistent with a mildly reduced level for her typical readings but not acutely alarming. Laboratory results obtained prior to any intervention provided further insight into her presentation. A test gauging her systemic acid-base status returned a reading of 7.32, suggesting a shift toward acidity that merited continued observation and possible additional studies to determine the cause. Her oxygenation status, measured in an arterial sample, showed a partial pressure of 74 mm Hg, which aligned with her subjective complaints of difficulty taking a full breath and feeling winded after minimal exertion. A renal function indicator remained within a reasonable range at 17 mg/dL, and she experienced no known deficits in her kidney output or filtration capacity, stating that her urine production and serum chemistry have generally stayed stable at her routine checkups. An electrolyte panel signaled that her serum sodium was on the higher end, with a measurement of 148 mEq/L, prompting the team to consider her hydration status and dietary intake. Additional labs revealed that her red blood cell concentration was at 50%, a figure that did not appear to compromise her oxygen-carrying capacity, and her serum glucose reading of 114 mg/dL appeared mildly above average but not indicative of a significant metabolic disturbance.nRadiographic imaging of her thorax displayed evidence of infection, along with a collection of fluid located around one lung field, which was consistent with the findings of dullness to percussion and altered breath sounds on physical examination. This fluid accumulation raised the possibility of complications related to her acute presentation, though she did not endorse any known chronic processes that typically result in recurrent fluid build-up in the pleural space. She recalled no abrupt changes to her usual patterns of activity besides progressive shortness of breath over the past several days, indicating that she continued performing the majority of her daily routines before feeling forced to seek medical attention for this escalating respiratory distress. She reiterated that she had no recent hospital admissions or major interventions, and her prior physician visits revolved around regular follow-up evaluations of her past neurological issue and intermittent monitoring of her liver status. Despite the significant respiratory findings, she did not exhibit confusion, speech difficulties, or notable lapses in memory during evaluation, steadily maintaining awareness of her situation. Given her advanced age and the multiple considerations posed by her past medical history, the clinical team determined that her symptoms, exam findings, and laboratory results warranted further in-hospital workup. Her stable but not entirely reassuring vital signs were taken into account before deciding on any acute therapy, ensuring that every relevant baseline measure was documented and understood prior to initiating treatment.",What is the patient's Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)?

The total score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.

The current PSI score is 0.
The patient is 75 years old. We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 75 = 75.
Because the patient is female, we subtract 10 points from the current total, making the current total 75 - 10 = 65.
The patient is not a nursing home resident and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 65.
Neoplastic disease is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 65.
Liver disease history is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 20 points to the score, making the current total 65 + 20 = 85.
CHF History is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.
Cerebrovascular disease history is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 85 + 10 = 95.
Renal Disease History is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 95.
Altered Mental Status is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 95.
Pleural effusion on x-ray is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 95 + 10 = 105.
The patient's pulse is 105 beats per minute. The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 105.
The patient's temperature is 37.6 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 105.

The concentration of BUN is 17 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 135.
The concentration of sodium is 148 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 148 mEq. To convert from 148 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 148 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 148 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 148.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148 mEq sodium/L converts to 148.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 135.
The concentration of glucose is 114 mg/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 135.
The patient's hematocrit is 50 %. The patient's hematocrit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 135.
The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 74 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 135.
The patient's PSI score is 135."
895,29,PSI Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP,severity,integer,15,Synthetic,"A 67-year-old male arrived at the emergency department reporting several days of worsening cough, mounting fatigue, and a high fever that he first noted upon waking the previous morning. He stated that his cough, initially nonproductive with mild throat irritation, had evolved into a deeper, more distressing pattern over the last day or so, and he began to experience chills and consistent warmth to the touch. At presentation, he was alert and engaged, conversing readily without any signs of confusion or mental cloudiness. According to him, he lives independently in a single-story residence and has not required ongoing skilled care or around-the-clock supervision. He recalls a neurological event several years ago that temporarily affected his speech and coordination, though he says he eventually recovered with rehabilitative support. He also mentions that he has required periodic evaluations for a medical condition tied to certain aspects of his metabolism, though he reports having remained stable in recent times with no major flare-ups. Nevertheless, he became concerned when his current symptoms failed to improve with usual home measures such as rest and oral hydration. On evaluation, his core temperature was measured at 38.9 degrees Celsius, reflecting a significant fever consistent with the abrupt onset of his symptoms. Physical assessment showed that he was breathing at a rate of about 17 breaths per minute and maintaining a heart rate of approximately 100 beats per minute, which he acknowledged felt faster than normal for him when he attempted mild activity. His blood pressure was recorded as 135 mm Hg on the systolic reading, aligning with a stable circulatory status for someone of his age. He displayed no outward evidence of fluid accumulation in his lower extremities or jugular venous distension, and he denied any chest pain beyond the occasional discomfort from deep coughing. When asked about his general medical history, he stated he had been followed intermittently over the years for a significant but well-controlled liver-related condition, which had not necessitated recent hospital admissions. Initial laboratory results showed a mild disturbance in his acid-base balance, with a pH documented at 7.46, though his clinical examination did not suggest any overt respiratory or metabolic compromise. He was found to have a partial pressure of oxygen of 87 mm Hg on room air, confirming that his oxygen level was somewhat lower than desired for an individual without known chronic lung issues. Additional lab testing highlighted an elevated blood urea measurement of 31 mg/dL, raising suspicion that he might be experiencing increased protein breakdown or a reduced intravascular volume status, which could complicate recovery. His serum sodium concentration was noted to be 132 mEq/L, just below normal limits, which, in conjunction with his ongoing fever and reduced oral intake, could signify evolving electrolyte fluctuations. A hematocrit value of 33% indicated a borderline low red cell volume, though he reported no significant dizziness or lightheadedness beyond what he assumed stemmed from feeling feverish. His measured glucose of 128 mg/dL was slightly above his baseline, which he attributed to decreased appetite and occasional sugary sports drinks he consumed to stay hydrated when his cough worsened. Chest auscultation revealed coarse breath sounds over the right lateral lung fields, and imaging confirmed findings of inflammation and fluid layering within the thoracic cavity, consistent with a localized infectious process and excess fluid accumulation. Despite his evident infection and the presence of fluid in the pleural space, he remained oriented throughout the conversation, recounting details about his daily activities and stressing that he has never relied on institutional living arrangements. The team acknowledged that his prior neurological history and ongoing liver-related concerns, though not actively flaring, could affect his overall resilience. With that in mind, he was prepared for further evaluation and management directed at controlling his acute condition, including monitoring of his oxygen levels, repeating relevant laboratory analyses, and ensuring any unstable parameters were addressed without delay.",What is the patient's Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)?

883,29,PSI Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP,severity,integer,3,Synthetic,"A 68-year-old male presented to the emergency department after three days of progressive shortness of breath, productive cough, and generalized malaise. He noted an intermittent fever at home, which worsened on the day of admission, along with chills and night sweats. He has been feeling more fatigued than usual, struggling to complete his routine morning walks without pausing to catch his breath, and has also experienced mild chest tightness upon exertion. On initial evaluation, he was awake, alert, and oriented, conversing clearly without lapses in memory or concentration. He denied experiencing any acute episodes of unilateral weakness, facial droop, or slurred speech in the past, and he reported no longstanding liver problems. According to him, fluid overload symptoms such as progressive leg swelling, difficulty breathing while lying flat, or episodes of nighttime coughing have not been issues. He described a past difficulty with kidney function, requiring follow-up with specialists, and also revealed a remotest history of a malignant growth for which he received treatment several years ago. On further questioning, he stated that his usual medications include those needed to monitor both his chronic conditions and his past oncologic management, although he did not recall any medication specifically for significantly compromised cardiac output. He claimed that he has never been told he suffered from sudden neurologic attacks or blood supply problems to his brain and had not visited any facility for such concerns. He reported no sign of abdominal issues, and he had never been diagnosed with disorders that would impair liver enzymes or clotting factors. Recent activity levels have diminished because of his respiratory discomfort, which he first attributed to a seasonal change. However, with the escalation of his breathing difficulties and fever, he became worried. Despite staying hydrated, he felt persistently thirsty, and routine checks at home indicated elevated fingerstick readings, prompting him to mention prior abnormal glucose measurements to medical providers. On arrival, his vital signs showed a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg. His core temperature measured 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit, aligning with his complaint of fever. An arterial blood sample revealed a partial pressure of oxygen of 75 mm Hg, consistent with his labored breathing, and his serum chemistry was notable for a blood urea nitrogen level of 30 mg/dL. Further evaluation indicated that his serum sodium concentration was 136 mEq/L, and an arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.38. His hematocrit was 35%, suggesting a mild decrease in red blood cell concentration, and a random glucose test was 158 mg/dL, confirming the elevation he had suspected at home. Although he endorsed a history of kidney issues, he described meticulous monitoring of his fluid intake and ongoing consultations with specialists. He also confirmed that his previous cancer treatment had gone well, with no recent reactivations or complications, yet he undergoes periodic surveillance. There were no remarkable findings on examination that suggested significant fluid accumulation in his legs or lungs beyond what might be expected with an infection. He did not require continuous supplemental oxygen therapy at home, so the noted hypoxemia was new for him. Nonetheless, he remained conversational, followed commands appropriately, and displayed no confusion. The physical exam revealed inspiratory crackles over a focused region on one lung field, in keeping with his complaints of cough and breathlessness. After calmly recounting his symptoms and history, he awaited further imaging and laboratory assessment to clarify the etiology of his pneumonia and guide management.",What is the patient's Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)?

884,29,PSI Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP,severity,integer,4,Synthetic,"A 70-year-old female arrived at the emergency department reporting two days of productive cough, shortness of breath, and high fevers that she first noted upon waking with chills and body aches. She lives independently and was brought in by a family member who grew concerned when she became increasingly weak and required more effort to breathe. She has dealt with a chronic issue in which her heart has struggled to pump effectively, leading to periodic swelling in her lower extremities and exertional fatigue. She also has a longstanding liver-related condition that has intermittently required monitoring by her primary physician. She denies having been diagnosed with any serious tumor-related illness, nor has she had any significant kidney problems in the past. She notes no established history of lapses in mental clarity, and she has always received care at her own home. On examination, she appeared ill and fatigued yet still oriented, with significant tachypnea reflected by a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. She was febrile at 39 degrees Celsius with a heart rate of 104 beats per minute, and her blood pressure measured 122 mm Hg systolic. Auscultation of her lungs revealed coarse crackles on the right side consistent with an infiltrative process, although imaging did not show fluid accumulating in the pleural space. Laboratory testing at presentation indicated several notable findings. Her blood urea nitrogen measured 20 mg/dL, and serum sodium was recorded at 138 mEq/L, which did not deviate significantly from typical ranges. Her hematocrit level was 36%, suggesting a mild decrease from typical reference values, and her serum glucose was 142 mg/dL, slightly above normal limits. Analysis of her arterial blood gases revealed a partial pressure of oxygen of 80 mm Hg, suggesting reduced oxygenation yet not profoundly low, and her pH was measured at 7.44, which was within a physiologic range without significant evidence of acidemia. The patient had a documented pulse oximetry reading that correlated with her observed shortness of breath, prompting concern for community-onset pulmonary infection. She reported sputum production that was pale yellow, though occasionally streaked with darker discoloration, and her cough had grown more frequent in the 48 hours leading up to presentation. She indicated some mild discomfort in her upper abdomen, which she attributed to her preexisting liver grievances, though she denied any recent changes in her appetite or bowel habits. There was no suggestion of new neurologic deficits, and her medical records showed no events of stroke or transient neurologic complications. Before coming to the hospital, she tried over-the-counter medications for her fever but did not experience relief from her respiratory symptoms. She has not experienced any significant change in urine output, and she has never required dialysis or experienced issues that might suggest prominent renal dysfunction. A chest radiograph revealed patchy consolidation in the right lower lobe but no layering fluid universally suggestive of a complicated process. Although she does have a cardiac condition that has required occasional follow-up, her current chest imaging changes appear distinct from fluid accumulation around the heart. Further evaluation and management have been initiated promptly, given her age and comorbidities, but at the time of initial assessment, she was untreated other than her own attempts at self-care at home. Her clinical course in the emergency department will be monitored carefully, especially with concerns of infection given her chronic heart and liver conditions. All in all, her presentation is consistent with a concerning pulmonary infection acquired outside of healthcare settings, and her vital signs and lab values suggest she needs close attention for potential complication risk.",What is the patient's Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)?

The total score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.

The current PSI score is 0.
The patient is 70 years old. We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 70 = 70.
Because the patient is female, we subtract 10 points from the current total, making the current total 70 - 10 = 60.
The patient is not a nursing home resident and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 60.
Neoplastic disease is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 60.
Liver disease history is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 20 points to the score, making the current total 60 + 20 = 80.
CHF History is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 80 + 10 = 90.
Cerebrovascular disease history is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 90.
Renal Disease History is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 90.
Altered Mental Status is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 90.
Pleural effusion on x-ray is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 90.
The patient's pulse is 104 beats per minute. The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 90.
The patient's temperature is 39 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 90.
The patient's pH is 7.44. The patient's pH is greater than or equal to 7.35, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the current total at 90.
The patient's respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 90.
The patient's systolic blood pressure is 122 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 90.
The concentration of BUN is 20 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 90.
The concentration of sodium is 138 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 138 mEq. To convert from 138 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 138 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 138 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 138.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138 mEq sodium/L converts to 138.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 90.
The concentration of glucose is 142 mg/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 90.
The patient's hematocrit is 36 %. The patient's hematocrit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 90.
The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 80 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 90.
The patient's PSI score is 90."
888,29,PSI Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP,severity,integer,8,Synthetic,"A 74-year-old female arrived at the hospital complaining of a three-day history of progressively worsening cough, which she described as initially dry but recently accompanied by scant sputum production. She reported a notable surge in body temperature, measured at 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit on the morning of presentation, and expressed concern about rising fevers over the past several days. She described experiencing intermittent chills and increasing fatigue, particularly when attempting her usual household tasks. Although she occasionally finds it difficult to climb stairs due to a history of heart-related issues that require vigilance for fluid accumulation, she has managed her condition with periodic medical follow-up and close attention to her diet and daily weight checks. She mentioned that her breathing had become more labored than normal, and she found herself short of breath even with minimal exertion, such as walking across her living room. She denied any chronic issues suggestive of long-term kidney dysfunction and stated that her serum chemistry panels have historically been within acceptable ranges. She further explained that she had never been given a diagnosis of a serious or malignant condition, and she did not recall any episode in her life involving sudden neurologic symptoms like one-sided weakness, difficulty speaking, or transient blindness. Her daily living routine had been largely independent, and she resided in her own home without the need for extended care or specialized assistance. Upon examination in the emergency department, her vital signs included a heart rate of 97 beats per minute, a systolic blood pressure of 125 mm Hg, a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and the aforementioned elevated temperature. She indicated feeling somewhat lightheaded when ambulating, but she was able to communicate effectively and did not appear to be in any obvious distress apart from her labored breathing. Laboratory investigations performed before starting any treatment revealed a blood urea nitrogen value of 23 mg/dL, which she was informed is on the higher end of normal but does not necessarily suggest a chronic problem, especially in the absence of other concerning findings. Serum electrolytes showed a sodium measurement of 135 mEq/L, which was considered acceptable for her age and clinical status. Her glucose level at presentation was 115 mg/dL, which did not raise immediate concern for a significant metabolic derangement. A measurement of hematocrit at 40% was documented, indicating that her red blood cell concentration was not substantially reduced. Arterial blood sampling disclosed a normal acid-base balance, with a pH of 7.43, and her partial pressure of oxygen was found to be 86 mm Hg on room air, illustrating that she might need close observation for possible hypoxemia. Further evaluation included a chest imaging study that demonstrated evidence of infection in the lung fields and a clear indication of excess fluid layering within the pleural space. The presence of additional fluid raised the suspicion that her background of heart problems, which she stated had led to occasional lower extremity swelling and prior episodes of reduced exercise tolerance, could predispose her to more complications. However, she denied any knowledge of prior significant events beyond her known cardiovascular condition and maintained that she had not sought care for pneumonia in the past. She explained that her appetite had been poor for the last few days, possibly related to her persistent fever and cough, but she remained adequately hydrated at home. On auscultation, her lungs revealed diminished breath sounds and localized crackles in an area consistent with the imaging findings, supporting the possibility of an infectious and inflammatory process. Despite her clear signs of a pulmonary issue, she neither reported confusion nor appeared disoriented during assessment. Presenting data suggested no major disturbance in other organ systems, and she emphasized that she had never received any ongoing treatments aimed at controlling major chronic illnesses aside from her known cardiac difficulties. Her clinical team decided that she would require further in-hospital investigation and supportive measures for what appeared to be a significant respiratory tract infection, given her fever, compromised breathing, and lab results captured at the time of admission.",What is the patient's Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)?

She was increasingly lethargic and was less interactive with family for 3 weeks before presentation. She also had urinary incontinence and gait instability for the same period.
Accompanying family reported a fall 3 weeks before admission with significant facial bruising. A computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast posttrauma was reported to have central nervous system (CNS) atherosclerosis with ventricular dilatation that was out of proportion to the degree of cortical atrophy []. A working diagnosis of NPH was made and she was scheduled to see a neurosurgeon for further management.
On admission, the patient had flat affect and poor cooperation. There was no papilledema. She was unable to follow commands for a complete neurological examination. Serum chemistry revealed sodium - 142 mmol/L, potassium - 2.9 mmol/L, HCO3 - 25 mmol/L, chloride - 102 mmol/L, glucose - 298 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen - 21 mg/dL, and creatinine - 0.7 mg/dL. Magnetic resonance scan of the brain revealed subtle debris layering the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles without restricted diffusion, consistent with either intraventricular hemorrhage or pus [Figures and ].
She was febrile to 103°F. Blood and respiratory cultures were obtained and she was started on a broad-spectrum coverage for possible meningitis. She developed diabetic ketoacidosis, which was addressed. She had two episodes of seizure-like activity. A lumbar puncture was initially deferred, whereas NPH had remained the most probable diagnosis, and the patient had a high international normalized ratio (INR). It was performed emergently following clinical deterioration, with development of fever.
The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected had increased protein, decreased glucose, and mononuclear pleocytosis. It was subjected to Gram-stain, which showed yeast and the species of the yeast were confirmed to be C. neoformans on culture. India ink preparation of the CSF was positive for Cryptococcus along with a positive cryptococcal antigen test. The patient was dozed with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B and oral flucytosine. HIV test was negative.
The patient continued to deteriorate further and had a cardiac arrest on the same day. She underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation but could not be revived.

He was admitted to our emergency feeling unwell with 2 days’ history of vomiting and watery diarrhea, also associated crampy periumbilical pain. He denied a history of similar complaints in his companions, no change in his dietary habits preceding symptoms’ onset. He drinks alcohol occasionally; the last drink was 6 months before the presentation—no illicit drug use history. The initial vital signs were normal. Soon later, he became tachycardic with heart rate reaching 120 bpm, blood pressure 127/70 mmHg, and a normal temperature. He looked dehydrated; otherwise, his examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory workup was significant for initially low glucose 2.5 mmol/L (3.3–5.5 mmol/L), high serum creatinine 632 μmol/L (62–106 umol/L), and high blood urea nitrogen of 21 mmol/L (2.8–8 mmol/L). Serum electrolytes were as follows: potassium (K+) 6.3 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), sodium (NA) 144 mmol/L (135–145mmol/L), bicarbonate (HCO3) 5.8 mmol/L (23–29 mmol/L), and serum chloride 99 mmol/L (99–107 mmol/L). Serum aminotransferases were normal (ALT 31 U/L, AST 27 U/L). He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). Toxicology screening, including serum ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and urine for oxalate crystal, was negative.
Acidosis failed to respond to initial fluid hydration, including intravenous bicarbonate. Thus, the patient underwent 2 sessions of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (HD). After HD, his electrolyte disturbances improved, and intravenous fluid hydration continued. Acute kidney injury (AKI) workup, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, creatinine kinase level, and sepsis workup were unremarkable. Starting day 3, the patient was in a polyuric phase, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), producing between 3 and 6 L per day, and his serum creatinine was decreasing. He was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in good condition with a serum creatinine of 140 μmol/L (62–106 μmol/L). Figure shows serum creatinine trend during the hospitalization, Figure depicts serum lactic acid clearance during hospitalization.
Our patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI. Eventually, his prerenal insult led to acute tubular necrosis, as evident by the polyuric phase the patient exhibited on day three.",What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?

The concentration of sodium is 144.0 mmol/L. 
The concentration of bun is 21.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bun from mmol to mg. The mass of bun is 21.0 mmol. To convert 21.0 mmol of bun to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 21.0 mmol bun * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.021 mol bun. To convert from mol bun to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.021 mol bun * 28.02 g/mol = 0.58842 g bun. To convert 0.58842 g of bun to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.58842 g bun * 1000.0 mg/g = 588.42 mg bun. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 588.42 mg bun/10.0 dL = 58.842 mg bun/dL. The concentration value of 21.0 mmol bun/L converts to 58.842 mg bun/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 2.5 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 2.5 mmol. To convert 2.5 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 2.5 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.0025 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.0025 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 0.4504 g glucose. To convert 0.4504 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.4504 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 450.4 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 450.4 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 45.04 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 2.5 mmol glucose/L converts to 45.04 mg glucose/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 144.0 + (58.842 / 2.8) + (58.842 / 18) = 311.51722 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 311.51722 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 311.51722 mOsm/kg."

To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.02783 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 5.01385 g glucose. To convert 5.01385 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 5.01385 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 5013.85 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 5013.85 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 501.385 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 27.83 mmol glucose/L converts to 501.385 mg glucose/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 127.0 + (9.34 / 2.8) + (9.34 / 18) = 285.19044 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 285.19044 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 285.19044 mOsm/kg."
421,30,Serum Osmolality,lab test,decimal,pmc-8684410-1,Extracted,"A 74-year-old male with a history of two transient ischemic attacks was brought into our facility for altered mental status after being found unconscious by a relative. His social history was significant for 55 pack-years of smoking. Due to his mentation on arrival, no further history was obtained. Vital signs were normal on admission. Physical examination on admission showed non-responsiveness to sternal rub, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, and thick white plaques around the corners of his mouth. Examination of the extremities showed 1+ bilateral lower leg edema, and pulmonary examination revealed right-sided wheezes and rales.
On admission, the patient had an elevated blood glucose of 662 mg/dL (normal: 70-110 mg/dL), an anion gap of 15, ß-hydroxybutyrate of 1.86 mmol/L (normal: 0.02-0.27 mmol/L), point-of-care (POC) lactate of 3.3 mmol/L (normal: 0.5-2.0 mmol/L), serum potassium of 3.8 mEq/L, urine volume of 850 mL, and no ketones on urinalysis. The arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.48, HCO3 of 24.6, and PCO2 of 33 meq/L. The slightly elevated anion gap on admission is likely multifactorial. It could have been caused by the increase in the negative charge for albumin and enhanced production of lactate seen in metabolic alkalosis []. Conversely, it is also possible that scant ketones, which are produced in a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, as seen by mildly elevated β-hydroxybutyrate and the absence of ketones in the urine, could have contributed to the elevated anion gap [].
Additionally, the patient had hypernatremia (sodium of 185 mEq/L corrected for hyperglycemia), acute kidney injury (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] of 49 mg/dL, creatinine [Cr] of 1.55 mg/dL, from a previous baseline Cr of 1.01 mg/dL), and hemoconcentration (hemoglobin [Hb] 17.1 g/dL, hematocrit [Hct] 51.6%). Chest X-ray indicated a potential right lower lung zone infiltrate. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest indicated right lower lobe mass or consolidation, with multiple mediastinal and hilar masses as well as enlarged left axillary nodes compatible with lymphadenopathy, suggestive of malignancy and metastatic disease (Figures , ). CT of the abdomen showed heterogeneous liver attenuation but could not differentiate between nonocclusive disease and metastatic disease. Adrenal nodules and kidney nodular densities were also present (Figure ). CT of the brain showed a suprasellar mass measuring 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm (Figure ). The patient was started on half normal saline and insulin, and the acute kidney injury significantly improved on day 3; however, no significant improvement in sodium level was noticed after correction for elevated glucose levels (Figure and Table ).
Additional investigations for the refractory hypernatremia showed a urine osmolarity of 699 (normal: 50-1,400), urine sodium of 10 mEq/L (normal: 20 mEq/L), serum AM cortisol of 61.3 ug/dL (normal AM: 6.2-19.4 ug/dL), 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test cortisol of 6.06 ug/dL (normal: <1.8ug/dL) and ACTH of 228 pg/mL (normal: 7.2-63.3 pg/mL) (Table ). MRI of the brain revealed a 1.1 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm enhancing lesion of the optic chiasm without evidence of mass effect (Figure ) and small lymph nodes in deep portions of the bilateral parotid glands that were potential metastasis. Throughout the admission, the patient’s arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a primary respiratory alkalosis with secondary metabolic alkalosis (pH of 7.48, HCO3 of 24.6, PCO2 of 33 meq/L), which was persistent until discharge (pH of 7.48, HCO3 of 27.6 meq/L, PCO2 of 37 mmHg). Additional endocrine investigations demonstrated an follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) of 0.3 miU/L (normal: 1.5-12.4 miU/L), luteinizing hormone (LH) < 0.3 miU/L (normal: 1.7-8.6 miU/L), testosterone of 27 ng/dL (normal: 264-916 ng/dL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 0.01 u/iU/L (normal: 0.34-5.60 u/iU/L), and prolactin of 9.7 ng/mL (normal: 4.0-15.2 ng/mL). The plan was to obtain a lung biopsy to determine whether the mass was cancerous or not and to conduct a high dexamethasone suppression test for ectopic ACTH production. However, the patient declined further workup or treatment, opting for hospice instead.
Despite initial fluid resuscitation with half normal saline followed by dextrose water, the hypernatremia did not correct. The hypernatremia later resolved after the patient was started on desmopressin on day 7 of admission. The patient was sent home on hospice and was advised to increase his water intake.",What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg? You may take the alcohol content as 0 mg/dL.

The concentration of sodium is 185.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 185.0 mEq. To convert from 185.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 185.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 185.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 185.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 185.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 185.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 49.0 mg/dL.

Her blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg and arterial blood gas analysis was pH; 6.98, pCO2; 99 mmHg, pO2; 66 mmHg. She was immediately intubated and transferred to the coronary intensive care unit. Echocardiography revealed massive pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade (posteriorly 3 cm, anteriorly 2.5 cm, laterally 2 cm and 2.7 cm in adjacency with the right ventricle). The patient had non valvular AF and been receiving dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily for one year. In addition to dabigatran, the other medications included verapamil, budesonide, valsartan, and hydrochlorotiazide. She had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her blood tests performed 1 year ago showed serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL) and estimated creatinine clearance 136 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation).
On admission her blood tests showed blood urea nitrogen 163.9 mg/dL (normal range 16.6-48.5 mg/dL), creatinine 3.99 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL), estimated creatinine clearance 16 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation), fasting glucose 83.9 mg/dL (normal range 74-109 mg/dL), sodium 130 mmol/L (normal range 136-145 mmol/L), potassium 5.3 mmol/L (normal range 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), prothrombin time (PT) 44.5 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 123.7 s (normal range 26-32 s), international normalized ratio (INR) 4.79, white blood cell count 10.59 103/uL (normal range 4.4-11.3 103/uL), hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL (normal range 11.7-16.1 g/dL), hematocrit 25.7% (normal range 35-47%), and platelet count 183 103/uL (normal range 152-396 103/uL).
Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with echocardiographic guidance and 1500 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was removed. Pericardial fluid analysis showed hemoglobin 7 g/dL and plasma hemoglobin level of the patient was 7.7 g/dL. Cytologic exam was negative for malignancy. Biochemical tests showed total protein 5.4 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 707 mg/dL and albumin 2.98 mg/dL.
Six hours after pericardiocentesis, the patients' blood pressure was over 100 mmHg systolic and she began to urinate. Red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were made and post-transfusion hemoglobin level was 12 g/dL, PT 36.4 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), aPTT 100.5 s (normal range 26-32 s), and INR 4.1. On the second day after pericardiocentesis, hemorrhagic fluid flow via drainage catheter persisted and additional fresh frozen plasma transfusion was administered. Subsequently, PT was 25.3 s, aPTT 77,5 and INR was 2.3. Pericardial drainage was terminated after achievement of no flow through catheter and no pericardial effusion on control echocardiography.
Laboratory tests repeated on the fourth day of admission were as follows: blood urea nitrogen 109 mg/dL, creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, INR 1.4 and hemoglobin 12 g/dL. The patient was extubated after improved ventilation parameters. Dabigatran etexilate was omitted and other medications were continued. She was discharged 10 days after admission.

441,31,HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance),lab test,decimal,pmc-6167688-1,Synthetic,"A 44-year-old male was emergently admitted to our hospital because of hematemesis due to the rupture of gastroesophageal varices. Prior to admission, he had no remarkable medical history. There was no family history of liver diseases. He was not a habitual drinker and did not take other drugs. Two years before admission, his height was 172.2 cm, his body weight was 120.1 kg, and his BMI was 40.5. On admission, his body weight was 116.7 kg and his BMI was 39.4. Physical examination demonstrated mild anemia in the palpebral conjunctiva and hepatosplenomegaly in the abdomen. Neurological findings were not remarkable. Laboratory data are shown in Table . White blood cell count was increased (15,100/µL), and platelet count was within normal limits (18.3 × 104/µL), while hemoglobin was 7.0 g/dL due to bleeding. Biochemical examination showed serum total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, albumin 2.9 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 19 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 18 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 135 U/L, and gamma-glutamic transpeptidase 65 U/L, respectively. C-reactive protein was slightly elevated (1.33 mg/dL). Hyaluronic acid (187 ng/mL), type 4 collagen (248 ng/mL), and Mac2-binding protein (2.71 COI) were increased. Aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) [] and fibrosis-4 (FIB4) index [] were not elevated (APRI = 0.346 and FIB4 index = 1.08, respectively). APRI and FIB4 were calculated according to the following formula; APRI = AST level (IU/L) / upper limit of normal AST × 100 / platelet count (109/L), and FIB4 = age (year) × AST (IU/L) / {platelet count (109/L) × [ALT (U/L)]1/2}. Serum ferritin and ceruloplasmin were within normal limits. Hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core antibody, and hepatitis C virus antibody were all negative. Antinuclear antibody was elevated (×160), whereas antimitochondrial antibody and antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibody were negative. Immunoglobulins, including IgG, IgM, and IgA, were within normal limits. Coagulation tests revealed a decrease in the percentage of prothrombin time (53.6%). Hemoglobin A1c was 8.1%, glycoalbumin was 16.7%, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was 298 mg/dL, immunoreactive insulin (IRI) was 14.5 μIU/mL. Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) was 0.28. The QUICKI was a novel and accurate method for determining insulin resistance; QUICKI = 1 / (log fasting IRI [μU/mL] + log FPG [mg/dL]) []. Abdominal ultrasonography examination showed brightness, mild hepatorenal echo contrast, surface irregularity, dullness of the edge of the liver, and splenomegaly (Fig. –c). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated enlargement of the left hepatic lobe and splenomegaly, which corresponded to liver cirrhosis (Fig. ). Active contrast material extravasation was also seen, which represented active bleeding from gastroesophageal varices (Fig. , f). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed gastroesophageal varices (Fig. , h). White plug, which seemed to be the bleeding lesion, was also seen in gastric varices (Fig. ). The varices were treated by endoscopic injection sclerotherapy and endoscopic variceal ligation. The histological findings of liver biopsy were mild steatosis, mild chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate, and severe fibrosis in the expanded portal areas with bridging fibrosis and spotty or focal necrosis (Fig. –d). Vacuolation of the nucleus (Fig. ) and MDBs (Fig. ) were also seen. Immunostaining using anti-p62/SQSTM1 antibody (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan) demonstrated MDBs, which were irregularly shaped cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. , d) typically located in proximity to the nucleus (Fig. arrows). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis due to NASH. He was also diagnosed, for the first time, with T2DM based on the following findings: FPG exceeding 126 mg/dL, random glucose level over 200 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c over 6.5%. Because hyperglycemia persisted after admission, we started insulin therapy. After starting insulin treatment, hyperglycemia immediately improved.

456,31,HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance),lab test,decimal,14,Synthetic,"A 56-year-old male arrived at the clinic reporting persistent fatigue for several weeks, along with an unsettling increase in thirst that he typically notices mid-morning and again before bedtime. He attributes part of his low energy to an increasingly sedentary work schedule, which often involves spending long hours at a desk with minimal breaks for movement. He has also observed a gradual but continuous rise in his waist circumference over the past few years, attributing it partially to irregular eating habits that have included late-night snacks and an overreliance on convenience meals. Upon questioning, he discloses that his sleep has been less restful lately, with occasional awakenings in the early morning to drink water. He denies any episodes of severe dizziness or loss of consciousness but describes a mild lightheaded sensation if he goes too long without eating. Despite these concerns, he has not adhered to any formal exercise routine, aside from occasional brief walks when time permits, and acknowledges feeling easily winded when climbing stairs. He recalls that a family member had struggled with elevated blood sugar later in life, which raises concerns for him about the possibility of hereditary predisposition. On physical examination, he appears slightly overweight, with weight distribution favoring his abdominal area. Blood pressure readings on multiple occasions fall into the upper range of normal, though not definitively hypertensive, and his heart rate is stable. No visible abnormalities are noted in his skin or extremities, and palpation does not reveal edema or unusual swelling. Cardiac auscultation is benign, and pulmonary examination confirms clear air movement without adventitious sounds. He denies any chronic joint pain beyond mild knee aches he attributes to lack of regular activity, nor has he had previous hospitalizations. He admits to occasional late-night snacking on sweet foods and some reliance on caffeinated beverages during his workday. While he has attempted to modify his habits in the past by minimizing soda and candy consumption, he concedes that these efforts have not been sustained. Laboratory studies were collected in the early morning, after an overnight fast, and before any intervention or dietary guidance was initiated. These tests revealed a fasting sugar measurement of 130 mg/dL, indicating that his glucose regulation may be compromised. Additionally, a separate test showed that his insulin was 17 µIU/mL at the same fasting assessment. Other laboratory results demonstrate borderline elevations in certain lipids, although his renal parameters are within acceptable ranges, and he reports no known liver-related issues. He expresses concern that these findings, coupled with his family history of glucose irregularities, could signify an early manifestation of a more substantial metabolic disturbance. He does not currently take any prescriptions aimed at glycemic control and has no history of using herbal remedies that could influence his metabolism, aside from occasional over-the-counter anti-inflammatories for muscle soreness. He states a clear intent to explore dietary adjustments, such as increasing high-fiber vegetables and moderating his intake of refined carbohydrates, to see if these modifications help mitigate his symptoms. He seems open to gradually incorporating a more structured exercise regimen, though he worries about how his professional obligations and occasional fatigue might interfere with a consistent routine. The plan moving forward includes more frequent follow-up appointments to track his progress, monitor his weight, and re-evaluate his laboratory tests. He shows a motivated attitude toward preventing further metabolic derangements and expresses relief that his concerns are being addressed before more serious complications develop. At this point, he has not commenced any specific glucose-lowering agents, as his healthcare team intends to gather additional information and carefully assess the practicality of lifestyle interventions prior to considering pharmacological options.",What is the patient's HOMA-IR score?

She noted feeling more sluggish in the mornings and occasionally after meals, as well as experiencing minor tingling in her feet that concerned her, given several relatives had developed problems with blood sugar regulation later in life. She described her diet as moderately high in carbohydrates, often including sweetened beverages and refined grains, though she seldom monitored her intake in detail. She also reported a gradual increase in weight over the last two years, despite attempts to walk regularly in her neighborhood. Her mother had been diagnosed with an endocrine disorder characterized by elevated glucose levels, and her older sister suffered from similar metabolic challenges. During the patient’s examination, her vital signs were subtly notable for mild elevations in heart rate, although her blood pressure was only marginally above the upper limit of normal, and she denied any persistent headaches or visual changes. On inspection, she was found to have patches of darker, velvety skin on her posterior neck, raising a concern for insulin-related issues. Her waist circumference was increased beyond the recommended threshold for her height, suggesting that central adiposity had become a significant risk factor for metabolic compromise. She stated that she did not routinely check her blood sugar at home, but she felt thirstier than usual in recent months, occasionally waking up at night to sip water. She described no major changes in urinary frequency, though she admitted not always paying close attention to subtle patterns. Routine laboratory tests were ordered to evaluate her metabolic status. At the time of presentation, her fasting blood sugar measurement was 95 mg/dL with an insulin concentration of 8 µIU/mL. No prior pharmacologic therapy had been implemented for glycemic control, and she had only intermittently taken over-the-counter weight-loss supplements with minimal benefit. Her lipid profile from the same blood draw hinted at borderline imbalances, particularly in her triglycerides, though her total cholesterol remained reasonable. Her thyroid function tests were within normal limits, ruling out a primary thyroid disease contribution to her symptoms. She complained of generalized fatigue but did not exhibit significant muscle weakness on physical exam. She denied chest pain, palpitations, or a history of exertional dyspnea, though she did note occasional mild edema around her ankles after prolonged standing. On further discussion, she acknowledged rarely making dietary modifications beyond reducing portion sizes and had not enrolled in any structured exercise program due to time constraints. She expressed concern about her family history and worried that her early manifestations might eventually mirror those of her relatives. Based on the clinical assessment and the laboratory findings, it was determined that she exhibited risk factors for developing issues typically associated with imbalances in how the body handles glucose and the hormone involved in its regulation. Potential management strategies were discussed, but at this stage, no specialized pharmacologic therapy had been initiated. She was encouraged to pursue additional lifestyle adjustments and regular follow-up appointments to track and possibly stabilize her metabolic parameters before more overt complications could develop. The patient was amenable to increasing her daily walks, focusing on consistent dietary changes, and monitoring her weights at home. Further evaluation would assess whether she might require more rigorous interventions if her marker levels or her symptoms were to worsen over time.",What is the patient's HOMA-IR score?

453,31,HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance),lab test,decimal,11,Synthetic,"A 61-year-old female presented with concerns of increased thirst, fluctuating energy levels, and a gradual rise in weight over the past six months. She noted feeling thirstier during the late afternoon and occasionally waking at night to drink water, although she had not identified any substantial changes in her usual fluid intake until recently. She also mentioned mild fatigue in the mornings that sometimes extended through midday, causing her to feel less productive than before. She denied experiencing significant shakiness or dizziness except on one or two occasions when she had delayed her usual meal by several hours. Her previous medical history was notable for borderline cholesterol levels in her early fifties, but she had never been on prescription medication for metabolic or cardiovascular issues. She recalled that several family members on her mother’s side had faced challenges with maintaining normal blood sugar levels, although she was uncertain of the exact details of their diagnoses. Over the past year, she had been relatively inactive due to a busy schedule and had maintained a diet that included frequent refined carbohydrates and sweetened beverages. During this visit, her vital signs showed a pulse rate that was slightly above average, while her blood pressure readings remained in an upper-normal range. A routine examination of her heart and lungs revealed no overt abnormalities, and her peripheral pulses were intact without swelling in her extremities. She did, however, have an increased waist circumference, suggestive of central adiposity, and she acknowledged that her clothes had become tighter around her midsection. She did not describe any numbness or tingling in her feet, nor did she report any visual disturbances beyond needing stronger reading glasses, which she attributed to age-related changes in vision. She also had no darkening of the skin around her neck or armpits on inspection. Given her reported symptoms and risk factors, a panel of laboratory tests was drawn at the time of presentation to assess her metabolic status. These tests revealed that her glucose was 114 mg/dL, indicating a level that exceeded the typical range for ideal glucose control. At the same time, her insulin was recorded at 16 µIU/mL, which was considered on the higher side for a fasting measurement. She was not on any medication targeting blood sugar regulation, and she stated that she had not previously supplemented with herbal or over-the-counter products specifically aimed at reducing her glucose levels. She also noted that she had not engaged in any specialized nutritional programs, though she had been contemplating dietary counseling to gain better insight into her macro- and micronutrient consumption. On the social history front, she reported being a nonsmoker for the entirety of her life and rarely consuming alcohol. She did mention a lifelong pattern of preferring sweet foods, with desserts or sugary snacks featured in most of her daily meals. Physical examination of her musculoskeletal system did not show any joint abnormalities, and her neurological exam did not elicit concerns about peripheral neuropathy. She expressed a desire to investigate strategies that could halt or potentially reverse any progression toward more pronounced metabolic dysfunction, focusing especially on a shift to regular walking, portion control, and improved meal composition. She was counseled to monitor her overall intake and energy levels, keep track of any new symptoms such as blurred vision or excessive urination, and follow up in the near future for repeat testing on the same measurements. At this time, no pharmacological therapy was initiated, and she was encouraged to pursue dietary modifications and engage in modest but consistent physical activity to evaluate whether these interventions would stabilize or improve her laboratory markers in subsequent visits.",What is the patient's HOMA-IR score?

He stated that he had not paid much attention to his diet in the past year, often skipping breakfast and consuming large, carbohydrate-heavy dinners upon returning home in the evenings. He admitted a tendency to drink sugar-sweetened beverages for an energy lift during the day, especially when work demands were high and he felt his focus waning. He recalled that on several occasions, he experienced mild dryness of the mouth, prompting him to consume more liquids than he typically would. In addition to these symptoms, he had begun to notice that, if he delayed lunch, he became somewhat shaky and impatient, though these sensations would quickly resolve once he ate. Despite these signs, he initially hesitated to seek medical attention, believing that his symptoms were likely related to stress, the natural aging process, or inadequate sleep. During the past few weeks, however, he grew more concerned because his thirst and fatigue seemed to intensify, and he observed that his waist circumference continued to expand even though he attempted to reduce portion sizes at dinner. He denied experiencing severe episodes of confusion, persistent blurred vision, or significant weight loss; rather, his challenges revolved around escalating tiredness that interfered with his ability to complete routine tasks. When asked about family history, he volunteered that multiple relatives had encountered issues related to how their bodies handled sugar, although he lacked detailed information about their diagnoses or treatments. On physical examination, he appeared moderately overweight, with adipose tissue concentrated around his midsection, and vital signs revealed normal heart rhythm but slightly elevated blood pressure. He did not exhibit any marked skin changes, and a brief neurological check did not elicit clear deficits, although he acknowledged rare and fleeting tingling sensations in his lower extremities if he remained seated for prolonged periods. At the time of presentation, prior to any therapeutic intervention, laboratory tests were performed to evaluate his metabolic status. These tests showed a fasting measure of sugar at 98 mg/dL, which did not reach a dangerous threshold but was noted alongside an insulin level of 21 µIU/mL on the same sample, an outcome that prompted a comprehensive discussion regarding his potential risk for difficulties in how his body regulates energy. He mentioned that, up until this point, he had never taken any prescription agent specifically aimed at balancing these levels and had not consulted with a dietitian or engaged in structured exercise programs. He also remarked that his daily routine largely involved sitting at a desk, with infrequent breaks to move around and few deliberate physical activities outside of work. He reported no numbness or ulcers in his feet, and his vision disruptions were minimal, primarily described as slight fuzziness when fatigued rather than overt blurring. The clinical team raised concern that his ongoing lack of physical activity, high reliance on refined carbohydrates, and family predisposition might together pose a risk for progression of his metabolic challenges. Given his relatively mild symptoms and the morning test results, he was counseled on strategies to modify his eating habits by reducing sugary beverages, incorporating more balanced food choices, and setting aside intervals for mild to moderate exercise. He conveyed readiness to alter his lifestyle, provided that the recommendations were practical within his busy schedule, and he agreed to maintain regular follow-up so that his parameters could be monitored to detect any concerning upward trend and to ensure timely adjustments if his symptoms or laboratory measures worsened.",What is the patient's HOMA-IR score?

475,32,Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI),risk,integer,pmc-3651988-1,Extracted,"A previously healthy, 39-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with generalized edema lasting 1 month and with sudden-onset pain in her right lower leg, particularly when walking. On admission, her general appearance was acutely ill and generally edematous. A physical examination revealed that her blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, her heart rate was 90/min, her respiratory rate was 22/min, and her body temperature was 36.5℃. Her breathing sounds were clear, and her heartbeat was regular without murmur. A subsequent examination of her lower limbs showed asymmetric bilateral pretibial pitting edema predominantly in the left lower limb. In contrast, the right lower limb was less edematous and had very weak popliteal and pedal pulses. Delayed capillary refilling was also found in the right toes. The Homan's sign was negative.
Serum laboratory findings at admission were as follows: white blood cell count of 5,300/mm3, hematocrit of 39.5% with hemoglobin of 13.1 g/dl, and platelet count of 286,000/mm3. The serum sodium concentration was 141 mEq/L, the potassium concentration was 4.1 mEq/L, the chloride concentration was 104 mEq/L, and total CO2 was 28 mEq/L. The blood urea nitrogen concentration was 12.1 mg/dl, the creatinine concentration was 0.86 mg/dl, the serum total protein concentration was 4.3 g/dl, the albumin concentration was 2.2 g/dl, the total cholesterol concentration was 349.4 mg/dl, the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was 214.4 mg/dl, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was 111 mg/dl, and the triglyceride concentration was 120.1 mg/dl. The results of liver function tests were normal. The coagulation profile showed an activated partial thromboplastin time of 32.0 s, prothrombin time of 9.7 s, anti-thrombin III value of 82% (70-120%), protein C activity of 143% (70-130%), and protein S activity of 65% (58.7-119.2%). The anti-nuclear antibody titer was less than 1:40, the anti-double-stranded DNA titer was 30.9 IU/ml, the C3 level was 158 mg/dl, and the C4 level was 19 mg/dl. Anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin G, anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin M, and lupus anticoagulant were all negative. Urinalysis revealed 3+ proteinuria (spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 10.9 g/g creatinine; spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 7,406.2 mg/g creatinine) and trace hematuria (1-3 red blood cells/high-power field). To investigate the etiology of nephrotic syndrome, an urgent renal biopsy was performed.
Thereafter, although she had no risk factors for thrombosis such as immobilization, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, morbid obesity, or a recent orthopedic or gynecologic surgery, to rule out arterial thrombosis of the right lower extremity, lower extremity computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed. The CT imaging revealed that the right superficial femoral artery was occluded and there was no identifiable proximal source of thromboembolism in other large arteries (). On the basis of these CT angiographic findings, right lower extremity angiography was performed, which revealed a total occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery (). For the treatment of this condition, balloon dilatation was initially tried at the distal superficial femoral artery but failed. Hence, thrombectomy was performed with the Fogarty balloon catheter and the thrombi were successfully aspirated. After the interventional treatment, a good distal arterial flow was reestablished (). Thereafter, warfarin (5 mg/day) as an anticoagulant and corticosteroid treatments were initiated.
Subsequent transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic studies showed no evidence of intracardiac thrombus, vegetation, or other structural abnormalities including patent foramen ovale. Quantitation of proteinuria was confirmed by using a 24-hour urine collection that showed 10.2 g/day of protein excretion and 7.8 g/day of albumin excretion, respectively. Afterwards, with administration of warfarin and corticosteroid, the patient had nearly completely recovered from the edema and claudication and was discharged. The renal pathologic results were consistent with minimal change disease ( and ). Two months after discharge, her urine protein-to-creatinine ratio decreased to less than 0.1 g/g creatinine, her serum albumin level was maintained at 4.1 g/dl, and she had no further symptoms or signs of arterial thrombosis.",What is the patient's Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)?

The patient did not show any symptoms. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed dissection from the CA (), DPA, and splenic artery (SA). This aneurysm was not seen on an abdominal unenhanced CT taken 6 years ago in a medical check-up. The enhancing inner lumen of the DPA was derived from false lumen and that of the SA was derived from true lumen. The stenosis of proximal side of SA, an aneurysm measuring 2.5 cm on DPAA with unenhanced mural thrombus, and the connection of the distal side of the DPAA to transverse pancreatic artery (TPA) with stenotic change were confirmed (). A connection with DPA and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was undetermined. The current diagnosis was the dissection of the CA to DPA and SA, resulting in DPAA and SA stenosis. After the diagnosis was made, the patient was referred to the department of radiology by a vascular surgeon for the consultation of endovascular surgery to prevent aneurysm rupture because open surgery was thought to be quite invasive as it required distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and CA repair. He had received medications for hypertension. There were no remarkable findings in his initial laboratory data. We planned to embolize DPAA, SA, and dissected area of CA that allow to preserve vascular supply to hepatic artery from SMA via peripancreatic arcade and to distal side of SA via gastroduodenal artery (GDA) to TPA. An angiography from the CA revealed the enhancing inner lumen of DPAA from false lumen of dissected CA connecting to TPA (). TPA was revealed between the peripancreatic arcade from GDA and pancreatic tail artery that connected to the distal side of SA. A 4.5 Fr. Shepherd hook–type guiding sheath (Parent Plus 45: Medikit, Tokyo, Japan), carrying a triple coaxial system, consisted of a 4 Fr. intermediate catheter (Cerulean G: Medikit, Tokyo, Japan), 2.6 Fr. high-flow catheter (Masters HF: Asahi Intech, Aichi, Japan), 1.9 Fr. microcatheter (Carnelian Marvel: Tokai Medical Products, Aichi, Japan), was hooked on the CA. To prevent the coil migration into the TPA, a microballoon catheter (Logos: Piolax, Yokohama, Japan) was advanced to the distal side of the DPAA via the GDA to pancreatoduodenal artery and inflated at the sufficient point of the TPA through the additional 4 Fr. shepherd hook catheter placed in the CA from the contralateral groin site (). The 4.5 Fr guiding sheath and the 4 Fr. Shepherd hook catheter were inserted from the right and left side of the common femoral artery, respectively. Under microballoon catheter inflation, the distal side of the DPAA was embolized with detachable coils (PRESIDIO 6 mm × 20 cm, GALAXY 6 mm × 15 cm) through a 1.9 Fr microcatheter (). Afterward, the microballoon catheter was deflated. Then, intra-aneurysmal coil embolization was performed with detachable coils (Interlock-35 10 mm × 40 cm, 2 of 8 mm × 40 cm, 6 mm × 20 cm) through the 4 Fr. intermediate catheter (). Later, the microcatheter in the intermediate catheter was carefully advanced through the dissected portion of the SA and embolization of the affected area was performed with detachable coils (Penumbra POD 6 mm × 50 cm, Penumbra 6 mm × 15 cm, 4 mm × 8 cm, GALAXY 2 of 7 mm × 21 cm, 2 of 4 mm × 15 cm) (). Finally, coil embolization of the dissected CA was performed using detachable coils (Interlock-35 10 mm × 40 cm, 2 of 8 mm × 40 cm, 6 mm × 10 cm, 4 mm × 10 cm, 6 mm × 10 cm, Penumbra coil 400 2 of 10 mm × 30 cm) (). The final angiography from SMA after pulling out all the systems revealed complete occlusion of the DPAA, the proximal side of SA, preserving GDA to the TPA to the distal side of SA and preserving GDA to common hepatic artery to left gastric artery (). No complication including post-coiling ischemia or transient laboratory abnormalities in transaminases, amylases, or lipase was observed during and after the endovascular surgery.

468,32,Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI),risk,integer,pmc-7263708-1,Extracted,"A 68-year-old non-smoking Caucasian man initially transferred from a different hospital for evaluation of a brain lesion found on imaging. The patient has a medical history pertinent to BPH, and his family history was relevant for a father with colon cancer.
Six months earlier, his primary care physician (PCP) evaluated him for worsening urinary symptoms and subsequently referred him to a urologist. Upon further evaluation, his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was normal at 3 ng/mL, and his digital rectal examination was normal, for which a cystoscopy with prostate GreenLight™ (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) enucleation was performed for BPH diagnosis. Five months later and one month before this admission, he discerned progressive worsening of double vision. His PCP examined and referred him to an ophthalmologist, who diagnosed him with third cranial (oculomotor) and sixth cranial (abducens) nerve palsy, which was subsequently confirmed by a neurologist.
Subsequently, the patient was admitted to the other hospital, and upon admission, he was found to have an acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperkalemia. Laboratory studies showed white blood cells of 27 x 10^3/µL, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 201 K/µL. His chemistry was pertinent for sodium of 134 mmol/L, potassium of 6.5 mmol/L, chloride of 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate level of 10 mmol/L, a glucose of 159 mg/dL, creatinine of 13 mg/dL, uric acid of 19.6 µmol/L, chromogranin A of 656 µg/L, and PSA of 22.67 ng/mL. He received hemodialysis and underwent bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy, after which his AKI resolved. An abdominal CT scan showed findings consistent with diffuse metastatic disease to the lungs, liver, and peritoneum, and brain MRI showed brain lesions. Therefore, he was, subsequently, transferred to our hospital for further care.
Upon evaluation in our hospital, imaging showed findings consistent with earlier recognized lesions at the other hospital (Figures -). The patient was, therefore, seen by a multidisciplinary team of a neurosurgeon, an ophthalmologist, a medical oncologist, and a radiation oncologist. Biopsies of a perirectal mass showed a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor. The oncologist who saw him diagnosed him with metastatic SCC of the lung; therefore, he was started on one cycle of carboplatin/etoposide chemotherapy during his hospitalization, which he tolerated well and was discharged home.
A senior oncologist saw the patient, reviewed all his radiographic images, and questioned the initial diagnosis of lung SCC based on the patient’s clinical presentation of urinary obstruction, hydronephrosis, and AKI. Hence, the original tumor location speculated to be consistent with a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor/SCC originating from the urinary tract. The senior oncologist, therefore, advised cystoscopy for prostate biopsy, which was declined by consulting urologist because the “prostate exam was normal.” Consequently, the senior oncologist sent the patient to a second urologist who performed cystoscopy and informed the patient that everything was normal. The senior oncologist had a thorough discussion to explain the necessity of a meticulous endoscopic urethral examination and prostate biopsy. Subsequently, the patient took the senior oncologist’s advice, went back to the urologist, and underwent a repeat diagnostic cystoscopy. This time, biopsies of the urethra were taken and confirmed a high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. 
 
The tissue specimen from this case was compared to the patient’s previous perirectal mass biopsy and was found to have similar features. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains were negative for CK7, CK20, PSA, and prostate-specific acid phosphatase. Scattered individual cells were positive for nuclear NKX 3.1 and cytoplasmic CK5. Moreover, there was diffuse variable positivity for nuclear p63 with greater than 80% of nuclei were positive for p53 and diffuse strong positivity for CD56, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and synaptophysin (Figure ).
Based on the clinical history of disease distribution, the pathologist considered the neoplasm to be likely of either prostate or urinary bladder origin. Subsequently, the senior oncologist reviewed the urethral biopsy, remained suspecting the primary site of cancer to be originating from the prostate. Therefore, he advised for prostate biopsy. Finally, the patient underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, which confirmed that all 12 cores were positive for prostate SCC (Figure ). The pathology findings confirmed the senior oncologist’s initial surmise that the metastatic cancer origin was from the genitourinary tract, likely involving prostate extending into the urethra.",What is the patient's Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)?

He developed mild dyspnea within 48 hours of arrival to Colorado but returned to Ohio after five days with increasing dyspnea that did not improve with descent. His initial evaluation revealed a pale mildly diaphoretic adult in severe respiratory distress who was able to speak in short sentences. His initial vital signs were blood pressure 189/101mmHG, temperature 37°C, respirations of 40 breaths per minute, and pulse rate of 112 beats per minute. Physical exam was significant for normal cardiac exam except tachycardia, increased work of breathing, conversational dyspnea, bibasilar rales, normal heart sounds, 2+ distal pulses without peripheral edema and mildly diaphoretic cool skin. Oxygen saturation on room air was 72% and chest X-ray demonstrated pulmonary edema without cardiomegaly (). Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia of 104 beats per minute with minimal flattening of the T-waves in V5 and V6. Lab work revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 21.6 Reference Interval (RI) (4.5–11.5E9/L), a normal hemoglobin of 13.7 RI (12.5–16.5g/dl) and an elevated brain natriuretic peptide level of 1031 RI (0–125pg/dl), three serial troponin levels were less than 0.01 RI (0.00–0.03ng/mL). D-dimer level was not obtained due to the pulmonary infiltrates and a basic metabolic panel was normal, as was a viral respiratory film array panel, and two sets of blood cultures. A trans-thoracic echocardiogram revealed normal valvular function and an ejection fraction of 65% with normal diastolic function. The echocardiogram did not include a pulmonary ultrasound and B-lines were not assessed. Pulmonary consultation noted rapid resolution of the pulmonary infiltrates as well as hypoxia with the emergency department treatment and a decision not to perform bronchoscopy was made. In the emergency department, nitroglycerine 0.4mg sublingually, extended-release nifedipine 30 mg orally, and dexamethasone 10mg intravenously were administered. A brief emergency department literature review led to this therapeutic regimen. Due to persistent dyspnea despite resolving hypoxia, he was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) at 15/5 cmH2O with further improvement in his dyspnea. Due to the local lack of familiarity with HAPE, he was admitted to the intensive care unit where the BIPAP was continued until he could be weaned to room air and was subsequently discharged on no medications. He was counseled against further trips to high altitude without acclimatization.",What is the patient's Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)?

479,32,Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI),risk,integer,pmc-8708478-1,Extracted,"A 55-year-old man was first evaluated in a nephrology unit because of hypertension associated with progressive kidney failure and proteinuria. At that time, the patient presented a history of hypertension since the age of 42, hypoacusia, a superficial venous thrombosis event, and incidental evidence of cerebral ischemia.
Blood and urine tests revealed a IIIb CKD stage renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 1.92 mg/dL, MDRD GFR 39 mL/min/1.73 mq) with mild proteinuria (0.821 g/24 h). Urine sediment was clear. A kidney biopsy was performed to explore renal disease etiology, showing non-specific advanced chronic lesions (global glomerulosclerosis in 70% of glomeruli and segmental glomerulosclerosis in 10% of glomeruli, moderate interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy, and severe arteriolosclerosis). Therapy with ACE-inhibitor was hence started.
Two years later, at the age of 57, a significant concentric LVH (basal septum region 18 mm) was detected during an echocardiographic evaluation for hypertension.
Renal follow-up showed a progressive decline in renal function reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at the patient’s age of 61. Chronic peritoneal dialysis was started, and one year later, he underwent renal transplantation from a deceased donor without complications.
When the patient was 63 years old, he began complaining of dyspnea during intense exercise. Echocardiography showed worsening LVH (maximum wall thickness of 24 mm) associated with pronounced tissue hyperechogenicity and right ventricular hypertrophy, finally raising the suspicion of Fabry disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of reduced α-galactosidase A activity measured on dried blood spots (DBS) (0.5 µmol/L/h (reference values > 2.8)) and with molecular analysis revealing the N215S GLA mutation. Increased levels of lysoGb3 on DBS (6.4 ng/mL (reference values 0.0–3.5)) were detected. At diagnosis, serum creatinine was 1.23 mg/dL, and proteinuria was 0.3 g/24 h.
Thus, in March 2019, the patient was referred to our Rare Disease Center for Fabry disease management and follow-up. The Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI) was 40/76 (General score—3; Neurological score—3; Cardiovascular score—16; and Renal score—18), and the total assessment Fabry Disease Severity Scoring System (DS3) was 46/80 (Peripheral Nervous System domain—0; Renal domain—23; Cardiac domain—18; Central Nervous System domain—1; and Patient-Reported domain 4).
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) showed severe biventricular hypertrophy with reduced native T1 values, suggesting myocardial glycosphingolipid storage. The left ventricular mass index was 198.4 g/m2. Extensive late gadolinium enhancement was also detected in the infero-lateral wall, with an increased T2 value indicating myocardial edema ().
An initial 24-h Holter monitoring revealed two runs of atrial fibrillation, which required the introduction of anticoagulant therapy.
One year later, in 2020, two runs of monomorphic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia were detected during a further 24-h Holter monitoring. Thus, an ICD was implanted.
Therapy with agalsidase beta at a standard dose of 1 mg/kg every two weeks, administered at our center, was initiated in June 2019. In March 2020, the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic dramatically affected the Northern regions of Italy. Thus, the patient asked to switch to oral therapy to avoid hospital access or contact with health care workers in the case of home treatment activation. No contraindications to chaperone therapy were found (serum creatinine 1.28 mg/dL, MDRD GFR 60 mL/min/1.73 mq). We thereby started migalastat at a standard dose of 123 mg orally every other day. The patient did not show any side effects of migalastat such as headache, runny or stuffy nose, urinary tract infection, nausea, or fever. After one year of migalastat treatment, the patient was stable in terms of symptoms, renal function (serum creatinine 1.30 mg/dL, proteinuria 0.275 g/24 h), and cardiac function (CMR in March 2021 showed substantially stable cardiac features). No adjustments in the immunosuppressor dosage, namely prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus, were required. In addition, we detected a reduction in lysoGb3 levels (4.3 ng/mL; a reduction of 33% from the patient’s basal values) and an increase in α-galactosidase A activity measured on dried blood spots (1.1 µmol/L/h; an increase of 120% compared to the patient’s basal values).
To confirm the kidney disease etiology, we recently analyzed the residual material from the native kidney biopsy by electron microscopy, finding abundant electron-lucent microvacuoles in many cell types and multivacuolized appearance of podocytes ().",What is the patient's Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)?

The patient had no significant medical history. He received intramuscular penicillin G followed by oral levofloxacin 500 mg/day without improvement before the admission.
His vital signs were noted for a temperature of 39.4°C, pulse rate of 105 beats/min, blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 per minute. Blood oxygen saturation on room air was 97%. He had bilateral tonsillar enlargement, covered by white exudation. Furthermore, bilateral and tender anterior cervical adenopathy was palpable. The abdominal examination revealed splenomegaly without tenderness. Other physical examinations were unremarkable. The result of complete blood count (CBC) showed 15,600/μL leucocytes with 38% polymorphonuclears and 57% lymphocytes. The peripheral blood smear displayed 37% of atypical lymphocytosis without any blast cells. The liver function tests were within normal limits. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 90 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 127 mg/L. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of COVID-19 was negative. The blood culture was negative.
The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis (IM). Acute EBV infection was confirmed by the positive IgM viral capsid Ag (VCA Ag). The patient's abdominal sonography showed splenomegaly.
Due to the severity of the patient's dysphagia and the high risk of upper airway obstruction, he received intravenous (IV) dexamethasone 8 mg twice a day. His condition improved partially after three days and was discharged from the hospital with oral prednisolone 30 mg/day.
Two days after discharge, the patient returned with high-grade fever, throat pain worsening, and dysphagia. Pharyngeal examination showed erythema and bilateral tonsillar swelling with whitish exudate. The ESR was 85 mm/hr.
The head and neck computed tomography (CT) scan with IV contrast demonstrated bilateral peritonsillar abscess (PTA) (measuring 23 × 45 mm on the right and 14 × 17 mm on the left side) (Figures and ). A chest and abdominal CT scan was done for ruling out lymphoma, which showed splenic enlargement with a wedge-shaped, low-density defect in the peripheral area of the spleen in favor of splenic infarction (). The results of electrocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography were unremarkable.
Since the patient was treated with various antibiotics before the admission and the history of the first hospitalization, considering resistance organisms such as Fusobacterium necrophorum, IV piperacillin-tazobactam was administered. Also, a bilateral tonsillectomy was performed with no subsequent complications.
The histopathologic examination of the tonsils showed reactive follicular hyperplasia and abscess formation. Despite negative abscess culture results, IV antibiotic therapy was continued for seven days. As the splenic infarction was asymptomatic, it was managed conservatively. The patient was discharged by oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with the favorable condition and recommended to perform an abdominal CT scan two weeks later to follow up splenic infarction.

978,36,Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005),risk,integer,18,Synthetic,"A 63-year-old male comes to the clinic for a preoperative evaluation in anticipation of a minimally invasive procedure on his knee, which has exhibited recurrent stiffness and discomfort ever since he resumed activity following a substantial abdominal operation he underwent several weeks ago. According to his recollection, the earlier operation required an extensive incision and a prolonged stay in the hospital for monitoring, during which he eventually recovered enough to be discharged home with instructions to gradually increase his physical activity. However, soon after returning home, he developed signs of a recent lung infection manifested by fever, productive coughing, and shortness of breath, ultimately requiring prompt intervention with antimicrobial therapy. He states that once the respiratory symptoms resolved, he attempted to resume a more normal routine, reporting that he feels able to rise from a seated position, walk around his home, and climb short flights of stairs without undue restriction or dependence on assistive devices. Despite this relative return to mobility, he has lately noted swelling in both of his lower extremities, particularly around late afternoon or evening, when the calves appear mildly puffy and retain indentations if pressed with a finger. He emphasizes that he has never before observed this kind of persistent lower-limb swelling and wonders whether his recent prolonged inactivity during hospitalization contributed to fluid retention. He has no history of twisted superficial vessels along his legs, denies any prior blockages in deep veins or breathing issues due to clots traveling to his lungs, and mentions that none of his close relatives have reported significant benefits or injuries related to irregular blood clotting. He likewise acknowledges no history of severe infections in the bloodstream or any widespread injury that would have confined him to bed for an extended period aside from his recent recovery period. With regard to fractures, he underscores that he has not experienced any broken bones in his hips or legs in modern memory, nor has he faced neurological complications leading to sudden paralysis. In discussing other conditions, he states he has never been diagnosed with an ongoing inflammatory disorder affecting his intestines, has not encountered an episode of reduced blood flow to his heart muscle requiring urgent cardiology intervention, and remains free of chronic lung conditions that would necessitate daily inhaled therapies. He also clarifies that he has had no formal diagnosis of any type of tumor or malignancy, and routine health screenings have consistently shown no evidence of suspicious growths. In terms of laboratory findings, he reports that previous assessments have never revealed any abnormalities regarding specific factors involved in thrombosis or unusual markers that might predispose him to bleeding or clot formation, and he has never been advised to discontinue certain medications because of platelet-related complications. On current examination, he appears stable, with normal heart and lung sounds on auscultation and no acute distress, though mild bilateral edema is evident below the knees. He expresses particular concern about this swelling since it is a new development, but he remains intent on proceeding with his planned procedure, which will be carried out via small incisions to visualize and address an ongoing structural issue in the affected knee. Overall, he exhibits optimism that correcting the joint problem through careful surgical intervention will restore more consistent functionality to his leg and, in turn, allow him to better manage daily activities without the setbacks he has faced since his recent hospitalization.",What is the patient's Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism?

972,36,Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005),risk,integer,12,Synthetic,"A 68-year-old female arrives for evaluation in advance of a small-scale surgical procedure intended to address a superficial skin lesion on her lower leg. She reports that this intervention is scheduled following a period of significant inactivity, as she has been spending nearly all of her time in bed for the past several days due to episodes of fatigue and intermittent discomfort in her limbs. She notes that she has required help with even basic mobility tasks, rarely walking beyond short distances within her home. On direct questioning, she explains that she has observed an unusual degree of swelling in both of her lower legs recently, describing how they seem to retain fluid by evening and occasionally feel tight when she tries to stand upright. She recalls no prior diagnosis of similar leg problems, other than periodic mild fluid retention in years past that typically resolved with rest and elevation. She emphasizes that, in spite of this new swelling, she has never experienced clotting events in her veins or lungs, and she denies undergoing imaging for suspect blockages in her circulation at any point. When asked about personal heart-related complications, she admits having encountered a sudden event several weeks ago that led to hospital care for reduced blood flow to a critical area of her heart muscle. Care providers used intravenous agents and close monitoring, after which her chest pain subsided, leaving her with instructions to adhere to a medication regimen and limit strenuous activity to aid in recovery. She has since followed that guidance, although she expresses concern that prolonged inactivity has contributed to her escalating leg swelling and general deconditioning. Regarding familial medical history, she remarks that at least one close relative experienced a significant venous obstruction in the past, which prompted evaluation for inherited clotting tendencies in family members. She was personally tested for certain known deficiencies but was told that the results did not reveal any specific genetic anomaly directly implicated in abnormal blood clot formation. She has not undergone any recent abdominal or orthopedic operations of major scope, and she denies receiving invasive vascular lines that remain in place for extended durations. She further indicates that she has never been informed of a deficient enzyme level or encountered unusual antibodies that would predispose her to circulatory complications. She likewise denies having encountered a sudden reduction in platelets in response to common intravenous therapies, and she states no physician has ever suggested that she harbors any obscure tendencies toward excessive coagulation or problematic bleeding. She clarifies that her bowel habits are largely stable and that she has not been diagnosed with an ongoing inflammatory condition of the intestines. She also notes that her breathing is stable in most situations, except when climbing stairs too quickly, and she has not been prescribed regular inhaled medications for any chronic lung disease. She reports no prior or current diagnosis of a malignant process and has not undergone treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. On examination, she appears alert but fatigued, with both calves showing pitting edema that worsens when she dangles her legs off the bed. Auscultation of her heart and lungs reveals no acute abnormality, and her superficial skin lesion has minimal redness with no overt signs of local infection. She remains hemodynamically stable, without fever, and her laboratory results do not point to any stark abnormality in blood counts or basic metabolic indices. She is hopeful that by proceeding with this minor intervention, she can avoid further complications while also addressing the lesion that has been giving her discomfort. She acknowledges that her extended bed rest has limited her physical conditioning, and she intends to follow recommended protocols to ensure proper circulation and minimize the likelihood of adverse events as she recovers fully from her recent cardiac issue. Despite her current challenges, she appears motivated to resume more regular activity and minimize further setbacks once her doctors clear her for routine ambulation and progressive exercise.",What is the patient's Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism?

She reports that this operation has been scheduled due to her chronic epigastric discomfort and a concern for possible adhesions from prior treatments, though she clarifies she has not undergone any substantial open interventions or larger-scale procedures in the recent month. She describes having been in reasonable health overall and denies any new-onset cardiac symptoms or troublesome changes in breathing during this time; in fact, she recalls completing her usual daily activities without limitation, including light exercise and regular household tasks. She shares that she has no recent history of persistent cough, fever, or respiratory compromise that might suggest a lingering lung-related illness. Furthermore, she has not experienced significant limb swelling or tightness, and her legs appear free of external abnormalities on inspection, which aligns with her lack of complaints regarding lower extremity heaviness or superficial venous concerns. She explains that she is able to move about readily, indicating a normal level of physical function for her age, as she lives independently, navigates stairs without assistance, and usually walks for mild exercise. Although she does not require assistive devices, she acknowledges a slight decrease in her stamina that she attributes to general stress and intermittent pains in the upper abdomen that led to her planned laparoscopic procedure. She denies having been diagnosed with occlusive clots in the legs or the lungs in the past, stating she has never been placed on extended courses of anticoagulant medication nor been hospitalized for vascular blockages. However, she mentions that a blood relative suffered a serious clotting event earlier in life, which makes her somewhat cautious about her own risk profile. She recalls discreet discussions with her healthcare providers in previous years, during which she was tested for known genetic contributors to excessive clotting, although those screenings did not highlight any specific worrisome mutations at the time. Still, she remains attentive to possible signs of circulatory problems, given her family’s unexpected experience. With respect to her broader medical background, she acknowledges that she was once diagnosed with a malignant process, for which she received appropriate therapy and follow-up. According to her account, she remains under regular surveillance to ensure no recurrence of that disease, and her most recent evaluations have not flagged any concerning developments. She also reports no recent difficulties pointing toward heart dysfunction, such as fluid retention, changes in exercise tolerance, or prominent orthopnea, and she emphasizes that her current ability to climb stairs and walk moderate distances without shortness of breath reassures her about her cardiac status. She denies involvement in any major accident or incurring extensive injuries that might confine her to bed for an extended period, and explicitly states she has not endured repeated trauma incidents or undergone any rigorous bone repairs in recent weeks. Her daily vital sign recordings at home have been stable without significant fluctuations, and she has had no episodes of fainting, severe dizziness, or chest pain that might prompt emergent cardiovascular evaluation. She also asserts that she has had no neurological deficits, explaining she has not experienced any abrupt weaknesses, facial drooping, or speech disturbances consistent with a cerebral event in the last few weeks. The patient remarks that her plan to proceed with this keyhole-type surgery stems primarily from her desire to clarify the abdominal findings and alleviate her episodic distress, which intermittently hinders her enjoyment of meals. She has felt otherwise well-nourished, with no indication of bowel inflammation or related gastrointestinal disorders requiring special therapy, and she remains free of chronic pulmonary conditions that cause ongoing wheezing or frequent infections.

980,36,Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005),risk,integer,20,Synthetic,"A 74-year-old male presents for evaluation in anticipation of a scheduled procedure intended to replace a deteriorating joint in his lower limb, as his orthopedic team has advised that such an operation could significantly improve his pain control and mobility. He reports that, roughly three weeks ago, he underwent a substantial abdominal operation for a separate issue, requiring a brief hospitalization and a structured recovery period. Following discharge from that previous intervention, he notes that his overall condition improved until he experienced an acute neurological episode about two weeks ago, described by him as a sudden onset of left-sided weakness and a transient difficulty with speech. According to his account, those symptoms have since largely resolved, and he has been continuing a mild exercise routine at home to maintain strength in his limbs. He emphasizes that he is now able to walk unassisted around his home and even complete short errands on foot, which reassures him that his baseline function remains close to normal. However, lingering fatigue sometimes slows him, prompting him to proceed cautiously and use rest periods throughout the day. He denies any new significant cardiac or respiratory problems since his recent hospital admissions, remarking that he has not noticed concerning fluid retention, persistent cough, or episodes of feeling breathless that would indicate an emerging cardiopulmonary issue. Over the course of his adult life, he occasionally experienced troublesome gastrointestinal flare-ups for which he was eventually diagnosed with a chronic condition affecting his bowel, and he recounts multiple strategies used in the past to control bouts of abdominal pain and irregular bowel habits. He states that at present, these gastrointestinal symptoms are fairly well controlled, and he has not required emergency evaluations related to that problem for several years. When asked about vascular health and family history, he remarks that his relatives have not reported unusual clotting events, and he himself has never been told that his blood tests showed concerning hereditary factors or autoantibodies implying predisposition to vascular blockages. Additionally, he specifies that no healthcare provider has previously diagnosed him with any irregularities in his veins, such as conspicuous surface-level abnormalities or pockets of fluid accumulation in his legs. He points out that even though he has struggled with knee discomfort for some time, he has never been advised that specialized supportive devices or immobilizing casts were required, and his clinical team has targeted this upcoming procedure as the most definitive way to restore his quality of life. During the interview, the patient underscores that he does not recall any direct trauma to the hip or leg bones recently, nor does he describe any systemic infections in the latest period that might have interfered with his recovery. On the day of evaluation, he appears oriented and cooperative, with stable vital signs and no evident respiratory distress. Physical examination of his lower limbs reveals limited range of motion in the affected joint, although this is not accompanied by swelling or signs of acute inflammation. He appreciates that his ability to move around has fallen short of his usual activity level, yet he still manages his daily household routines without outside assistance. He expresses optimism that once the new joint is in place, his ambulation will improve drastically, allowing him to resume longer walks and potentially engage in light recreational pursuits. While he is aware of the risks associated with an operation of this magnitude, he believes it is necessary given the persistent pain and mechanical difficulties that have compounded over time, particularly after his recent health challenges. Hospital notes confirm that his neurologic recovery is ongoing, and his clinicians plan to monitor him closely in the perioperative stage, especially in regard to ensuring stable circulation and avoiding potential complications. He has already met with nutritional experts to confirm that his diet is suitable for perioperative healing and to address his longstanding gastrointestinal background. As he awaits final approval for the planned joint replacement, the patient maintains a hopeful outlook, believing that careful attention to rehabilitation protocols and compliance with follow-up visits will allow him to emerge from surgery with an enhanced capacity to walk, climb stairs, and handle all the activities of daily life more comfortably.",What is the patient's Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism?

She notes that daily tasks such as walking up stairs, kneeling, and prolonged standing have caused substantial discomfort, prompting her orthopedic team to recommend a definitive procedure to improve her overall function. She denies having undergone any notable surgical intervention in recent weeks, stressing that her last operative procedure was several years ago, and she has experienced no recent hospital admissions for severe infection or acute cardiovascular events. She describes receiving specialized treatments in the past for a serious health condition characterized by uncontrolled cell growth, and she is relieved to report having remained free of active disease based on regular follow-up evaluations. Although her daily routine has been somewhat hindered by chronic knee pain, she continues to maintain the ability to ambulate unassisted, performing most household activities independently and without external support. She has not noticed any conspicuous enlargement or fluid retention in her legs, nor has she detected anything unusual such as cramping pain or localized redness that might point toward hidden vascular problems. She mentions never having been told she had a clot in her deep veins or in the circulation leading to her lungs, yet she expresses concern about her risk of future events due to a strong pattern of clotting episodes affecting multiple members of her immediate lineage. Upon investigation, she reveals that during an earlier evaluation, laboratory assays demonstrated a notable genetic irregularity commonly associated with heightened clot formation, leading her care team to emphasize the importance of closely monitoring her circulation and possibly adjusting prophylactic measures in the perioperative period. She denies any additional hereditary or acquired disorders that might further predispose her to blood dyscrasias, stating that aside from that single confirmed abnormality, her past screenings have been unremarkable. She has not endured any major fractures or significant traumatic injuries to her hips or legs in recent months, nor has she worn a firm cast or similar device that would have forced her to remain immobile for extended periods. She also denies losing consciousness recently or experiencing transient weakness that might suggest neurological compromise, and there are no indications of devastating trauma involving multiple body regions or any impairment in her spinal cord function. She clarifies she was never admitted for grave bloodstream infections or faced severe respiratory conditions in the past month, and she has not presented any signs of fluid accumulation, orthopnea, or persistent coughing episodes that might be suggestive of a cardiac or pulmonary cause. During the interview, she emphasizes that her greatest worry arises from her familial background of pronounced clotting complications and her own confirmed susceptibility by virtue of an inherited abnormality. On physical examination, she appears alert and calm, with vital signs that remain within normal limits and no apparent distress at rest. Her left knee exhibits localized crepitus and discomfort with flexion, though there is no evidence of notable swelling extending up the leg or any bluish discoloration. She states that with adequate pain management and self-paced activity, she can still fulfill daily home tasks, yet she looks forward to a definitive solution for her chronic joint symptoms. She has been informed that the planned reconstructive procedure could substantially enhance her range of motion and overall quality of life, but she wishes to be vigilant in guarding against complications associated with clot formation, especially given her personal and familial risk factors. Despite this apprehension, she expresses motivation to proceed, visiting multiple specialists to optimize her readiness for the upcoming operative date, and she affirms she will follow any guidance regarding early postoperative mobilization and other relevant measures aimed at safeguarding her well-being.",What is the patient's Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism?

518,38,Free Water Deficit,lab test,decimal,pmc-3147132-1,Extracted,"A 28-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of reduced livido and increased fatigability. He had been in good health until 1 year earlier, when he noticed reduced livido. Four months before admission, he noticed frequent headaches, thirst, polydipsia, and polyuria. Because he was voiding urine every hour, he visited his family doctor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a suprasellar mass, and he was thus referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Although polydipsia and polyuria had been gradually relieved by the time of admission, he became aware of increased fatigability.
At the time of admission, he was 176 cm tall and weighed 72 kg. His temperature was 37.6°C, pulse rate was 60/min, and blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg. No goiter or enlargement of lymph nodes was noted. Axillar and pubic hair were lost and there was palpable erythematous rush on his forehead (). The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory results revealed the following results: blood urea nitrogen 9.6 mg/dL, creatinine 0.79 mg/dL, serum sodium 141 mEq/l, potassium 4.0 mEq/l, chloride 100 mEq/l, calcium 9.4 mg/dL, phosphate 3.7 mg/dL, fasting plasma glucose 80 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein 0.07 mg/dL. Endocrinologic data revealed a mild decrease in free T4 level (0.6 ng/dL) with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level (0.9106 μU/mL) and decreased cortisol (4.7 μg/mL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 6 pg/mL), luteinizing hormone (LH; 0.2 mIU/mL), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH; 1.3 mIU/mL), and testosterone (0.05 ng/mL) levels. Urinary cortisol was undetectable. Plasma osmolality was 288 mOsm/kgH2O, with a urinary osmolality of 239 mOsm/kgH2O, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) was undetectable (<0.15 pg/mL). Urinary output was from 1.5 to 2.2 L/day.
His clinical course and laboratory findings led us to suspect CDI with anterior pituitary dysfunction. We thus performed hormonal provocative tests. The patient was given an infusion of 5% saline at a rate of 0.05 mL/kg for 120 min. Although plasma AVP was undetectable before and after administration of hypertonic saline, urine osmolality (391 mOsm/kgH2O) increased above the plasma levels (296 mOsm/kgH2O) (). Hormonal provocative tests revealed that growth hormone (GH) response to GH-releasing hormone was normal, TSH response to TSH-releasing hormone was low and blunted, and FSH and LH response to LH-releasing hormone were low and blunted (). Although ACTH response to corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) was normal, cortisol response to CRH was low (maximum 13.0 μg/mL). Cortisol response to rapid ACTH stimulation test was low (maximum 15.9 μg/mL). Results of these hormonal tests were compatible with the diagnosis of CDI with partial GC deficiency.
MRI revealed enhancing lesion centrally in the pituitary stalk, which spread continuously to the bottom of the third ventricle, and the high intensity of the posterior lobe was lost, compatible with the diagnosis of CDI (). Considering the patient's age, we first suspected of neurohypophysial germinoma. However, this was unlikely because cerebrospinal fluid was negative for malignant cells, and β-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels were normal. Next, we suspected sarcoidosis because chest X-ray revealed hilar enlargement. A biopsy from the skin of the forehead was performed, which revealed noncaseating granuloma composed of epithelioid cells (). Multinucleated giant cells were also present. Thus, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made.
While waiting for histologic confirmation of biopsy results, hydrocortisone replacement was begun with a dose of 20 mg daily. Soon after the replacement therapy was begun, moderate polyuria (3.5–4.0 liters daily) occurred (). After the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was confirmed, he was treated with 40 mg of prednisolone and his general condition improved. The hypertonic saline test was repeated while he was taking 40 mg of prednisolone. Plasma AVP was undetectable during the hypertonic saline test and urine osmolality was consistently below plasma levels, which was compatible with a diagnosis of CDI (). He was treated with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP).
MRI following prednisolone therapy revealed a reduction in the size of the affected lesion. However, his pituitary function remained unchanged, and he is currently being treated with prednisolone, levothyroxine natrium, HCG, and dDAVP.",What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of kg? The desired serum sodium concentration is 140 mEq/L.

Adult female: 50% (0.5)
Elderly male: 50% (0.5)
Elderly female: 45% (0.45)
Child: 60% (0.6)
The patient is 28 years old. The patient's is a Male.
The patient's age is between 18 and 64 and so the patient is an adult. For adult male's the total body water percentage value is 0.60.
The patient's weight is 72.0 kg. The concentration of sodium is 141.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 141.0 mEq. To convert from 141.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 141.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 141.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 141.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 141.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 141.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.6 * 72.0 * (141.0/140 - 1) = 0.30857 L.

Polydipsia suddenly began one month earlier, followed by progressive general weakness. She was initially evaluated at another hospital for the possibility of diabetes mellitus, but laboratory data were not diagnostic for the disease. She had no history of systemic disease or trauma. A physical examination showed her height to be 150 cm and body weight to be 50 kg. The chest and heart conditions were normal. A breast examination was also normal. The neurological examination on admission was normal. The laboratory tests on admission showed serum sodium at 152 mEq/L, serum potassium at 4.1 mEq/L, fasting blood glucose at 103 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c at 4.9%. The results of the liver and thyroid function tests, as well as the chest X-ray were all within normal limits. We performed the water deprivation test under the impression of diabetes insipidus. Urine osmolarity, after a pitressin injection, was markedly increased (>50%) and the results revealed complete pituitary diabetes insipidus (). A brain MRI was performed to demonstrate abnormal findings in the posterior pituitary gland, but it showed multiple enhanced nodules with surrounding edema in the entirety of the cerebral hemisphere, suggesting brain metastases (). To determine the origin of the brain metastasis, we performed the following diagnostic procedures: mammography, abdominal CT scan, gastroscopy, and bone scintigraphy. The abdominal CT scan showed a 3.5-cm heterogenous mass of the right adrenal gland, which separated the kidney. The mass was suggested grossly as metastases and no other intra-abdominal mass was seen There was no abnormal finding detected by mammography. Two round-shaped, elevated lesions with central umblications were noticed on the antrum and low body of the stomach (). We performed a percutaneous needle biopsy of the right adrenal mass. Histologic examinations of both the gastric tissue and right adrenal mass showed malignant tumors composed of anaplastic cells (). Smears and a cell block from the right adrenal mass showed pleomorphic cells having bizarre nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, which were strongly positive for vimentin and weakly positive for cytokeratin immunostains, but were negative for synaptophysin. Thus, the right adrenal mass was suggested as a metastatic lesion from anaplastic carcinoma. The results of the immunohistochemical studies (cytokeratin, vimentin, desmin, smooth muscle actin, alpha-fetoprotein, and human chorionic gonadotropin) on the gastric tissues favored anaplastic carcinoma rather than sarcoma. The results of the c-kit from adrenal and gastric tissues were negative. The malignant cells of the adrenal mass were closely similar to the malignant cells from gastric tissues. Using an electron microscopy examination, the tumor cells of the gastric tissues were composed of a mixture of round oval cells and pleomorphic cells; and the tumor cells were occasionally joined by desmosome, which is suggested to be the origin of epithelial cells. However, there was no evidence of steroidogenic cells in the adrenal cortical carcinoma including in the well developed SER and mitochondria with tubular cisternae. The ultrastructural findings of the tumor cells were compatible with anaplastic carcinoma, including sarcomatoid carcinoma, rather than cortical carcinoma (). Therefore, the metastatic lesions of the brain and right adrenal gland were assumed to have originated from gastric carcinoma. Further evaluation with bone scintigraphy showed multiple hot uptakes in the patients bones. She was managed with conservative treatment including desmopressin. After the desmopressin treatment, diabetes insipidus was greatly ameliorated. However, she died 3 months after the diagnosis.",What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of kg?

The mass of sodium is 152.0 mEq. To convert from 152.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 152.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 152.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 152.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 152.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 152.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.5 * 50.0 * (152.0/140 - 1) = 2.14286 L.

He denied a history of similar complaints in his companions, no change in his dietary habits preceding symptoms’ onset. He drinks alcohol occasionally; the last drink was 6 months before the presentation—no illicit drug use history. The initial vital signs were normal. Soon later, he became tachycardic with heart rate reaching 120 bpm, blood pressure 127/70 mmHg, and a normal temperature. He looked dehydrated; otherwise, his examination was unremarkable.

Our patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI. Eventually, his prerenal insult led to acute tubular necrosis, as evident by the polyuric phase the patient exhibited on day three.",What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?

The concentration of sodium is 144.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 144.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 144.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 144.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 144.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 144.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 99.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 99.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 99.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 99.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 99.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 99.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 5.8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 5.8 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 5.8 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 5.8 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 5.8 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 5.8 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 144.0 mEq/L - (99.0 mEq/L + 5.8 mEq/L) = 39.2 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 39.2 mEq/L."

She was born to a 25-year-old G3P2 mother, with a weight of 1927 grams, at 36 weeks of gestation via vaginal delivery after induction due to IUGR at an outside hospital. The pregnancy was significant for intrauterine growth restriction noted at 5 months of gestation. The pediatrician was at the delivery, and no resuscitation was needed. Apgar scores were 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. Macroglossia was noted. Umbilical hernia and hypotonia were not found. The infant was noted to have hypoglycemia on day of life one and was given intravenous glucose and went on to develop hyperglycemia. Glucose levels were the 400 mg/dl, and an insulin drip was started. The infant was transferred to the NICU from the outside hospital due to hyperglycemia and concerns for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Due to concerns for NEC, oral feeds were discontinued and she was placed on TPN, providing a steady glucose load. No surgical intervention was necessary for the NEC. Glucose was difficult to control even while on TPN with blood sugar levels ranging from the 100s to >200 mg/dl. At about 1 month of age, glucose levels started dropping and insulin was weaned. During this time, due to an IV infiltrate, IV insulin was briefly discontinued and blood glucose was 268 mg/dl. Insulin infusion was restarted and was discontinued at about 1 month of age. Blood sugar levels ranged between 80 and 150 mg/dl. The infant was discharged shortly afterward, feeding ad lib and checking blood sugar before meals. She required intermittent subcutaneous insulin at home, which was finally discontinued at approximately 4 months of age. Since then, the patient did not require insulin or have diabetes symptoms. All developmental milestones were on time. At 15 years of age, she chipped her tooth and went to the dentist for evaluation. The dentist noted extensive tooth decay. Jaw X-rays showed bone loss of nearly 80% in the left mandible. Due to her history of TNDM, she was sent to her primary care provider for further workup and diabetes screening where blood glucose was 369 mg/dl and urinalysis showed positive ketones. She was sent to the emergency department, and laboratory examination showed blood glucose of 361 mg/dl, Na+ of 131 mEq/L, K+ of 3.4 mmol/L, Cl- of 96 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 19 mmol/L, 2+ urine ketones, and pH of 7.4. HbA1c was 15.4% during her admission. The diabetes autoimmune panel was negative (ICA-512, GAD-65, and Insulin Antibodies).
She endorsed long-standing polydipsia, polyphagia, and polyuria. She denied weight loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion, blurry vision, fatigue, fever, and difficulty breathing. Family history was negative for autoimmune diseases except for hypothyroidism in the paternal grandmother and maternal great-grandmother. Physical exam showed a weight of 58.4 kg (70th percentile), height of 163 cm (55th percentile), and BMI of 21.98 kg/m2 (70th percentile). She was a well-appearing adolescent without thyromegaly and acanthosis nigricans and had Tanner Stage 5 breast. She was started on basal bolus insulin regimen consisting of 23 units of Glargine at bedtime and fast-acting insulin Lispro 1 unit per 10 grams of carbohydrates with meals.
She received the appropriate diabetes education. Laboratory examination also noted a TSH of 66 IU/ml (reference range: 0.35–5.5 uIU/ml); free T4 was 0.94 ng/dl (reference range: 0.8–1.8 ng/dl), and positive antibodies to thyroid peroxidase was 8580 IU/ml. She was treated with 75 mcg Levothyroxine that was titrated to a dose of 100 mcg. The 6q24 methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MPLA) genetic test for transient neonatal diabetes identified hypomethylation within the 6q24 region. Deletion/duplication analysis ruled out paternal duplication of 6q24. Therefore, the hypomethylation could be the result of either paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 6 (UPD6) or hypomethylation of the maternal allele. Via testing, UPD6 has been confirmed, meaning both copies of the 6q24 chromosome region in our patient were paternally inherited. This results in an epigenetic phenomena where both copies are still active. Typically, the paternal copy is active and the maternal copy is methylated and turned off. Epigenetic changes are typically de novo, as they depend on the parent of origin and are reset with each pregnancy, rather than DNA sequencing changes. Thus, risk of recurrence for parents, siblings, and offspring is unlikely. After diagnosis and her initial HbA1c of 15.4%, her HbA1c has ranged since then from 6.3% to 6.8%.",What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?

It was associated with subconjunctival hemorrhage which prompted him to seek for emergent care. The patient reported sore throat for three weeks prior which was treated with over-the-counter cold medications. Initial vitals reported a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate 82 beats per minute, blood pressure 156/85 mmHg, and respiratory rate 20 per minute. On physical exam, the oropharynx did not show erythema or exudates, no palpable lymphadenopathy. Chest and abdominal exams were benign. Labs showed white cell count 12,800/uL, hemoglobin 14.1 g/dL, and platelet 154,000/uL, sodium 133 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 97 mmol/L, bicarb 19 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 95 mg/dL, creatinine 8.9 mg/dL, calcium 9.1 mg/dL, and liver function tests were normal. Urine analysis showed amber color urine, specific gravity >1.030, pH 5, protein >300 mg/dL, negative glucose, large blood, trace ketones, moderate bilirubin, negative nitrite, negative leukocytes, white blood cell (WBC) 10–25/HPF, red blood cell (RBC) 10–25/HPF, hyaline cast 10–25/LPF, and granular cast 0–2/LPF. Estimated 24-hour urinary protein excretion was 0.6 g/day. He was admitted and given volume resuscitation and broadly covered with antibiotics by his primary service. Nephrology was consulted in view of acute renal failure, proteinuria, and hematuria. Initial differential diagnoses of his acute kidney injury included PSGN, severe dehydration, IgA nephropathy, and vasculitis. Rapid strep A screening and throat swab culture were negative. C3 and C4 complements were <40 and <8 mg/dL, respectively. Total complement level was <10 U/mL. Anti-DNASE B antibody titer was 770 U/mL, and anti-streptolysin O titer was 285 IU/mL. Autoimmune workup was negative except antinuclear antibody titer of 1:160, and positive cryoglobulin with low cryoprecipitate. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed small bilateral pleural effusions, no renal masses or obstruction as well as normal appearing ureters and bladder. With supportive measures, creatinine improved initially, but blood urea nitrogen got worse. On day three of admission, he developed pulmonary congestion and diuresis was tried without success. He subsequently developed uremic symptoms. Intermittent hemodialysis was started as supportive therapy for PSGN, volume overload, and uremic symptoms. In spite of aggressive conservative therapy, he continued to be hypoxemic with persistent bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. It was suspected that he had sequelae of pulmonary-renal syndrome despite negative serology. Thus, he underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage which ruled out alveolar hemorrhage. He also underwent renal biopsy on day 22 of hospitalization. Renal biopsy identified acute tubular injury, enlarged glomeruli, endocapillary proliferation, neutrophils on light microscopy (Figure ), granular staining in capillary loops for C3 on direct immunofluorescence (Figure ), and subepithelial hump-like immune deposits on electron microscopy (Figure ). He had no evidence of tubular atrophy or interstitial fibrosis. The biopsy findings were consistent with PSGN. He was intubated for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and intravenous pulse dose steroids were initiated. He received three days of 1 g intravenous methylprednisolone followed by 500 mg daily for six days. The serum creatinine rapidly came down with daily improvement in urine output without further dialysis requirements. The trend of serum creatinine in relation to hemodialysis and steroids therapy is demonstrated in Figure . He was discharged with 20 days tapering course of oral prednisone. On the day of discharge, his serum creatinine was 1 mg/dL. On follow-up, renal function remained to be normal. He no longer required supplemental oxygen, and prednisone was tapered off.

567,40,Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa),lab test,decimal,2,Synthetic,"A 59-year-old male with a history of mild hypertension and no known chronic kidney disease arrived at the emergency department complaining of a three-day history of significantly reduced urinary output and increasing fatigue. He noted that over the preceding week he had experienced less appetite and some mild nausea but no overt abdominal pain or vomiting. He denied fevers, chills, or recent infections, though he had reported a modest decrease in fluid intake because of his nausea. On examination, his blood pressure was at the lower threshold of his usual range, and he had a notable dryness of the oral mucosa suggesting possible volume depletion. His heart sounds were regular, and his lung fields were clear to auscultation without evidence of fluid overload. There was no costovertebral angle tenderness or flank pain on percussion. A focused neurological exam showed he was alert but admitted feeling more lethargic than usual, particularly during the preceding two days. He repeatedly emphasized that his urine volume had been noticeably low since the start of his illness, and he described its color as darker than usual, though without visible hematuria. He had taken his usual antihypertensive medication but had not started any new drugs, including no recent exposure to nephrotoxic agents. He did recall using an over-the-counter analgesic on multiple occasions for mild headaches, though he was unable to specify the exact dosage or frequency. Blood tests revealed a mild elevation in the blood urea nitrogen. Measurement of creatinine was 1.1 mg/dL and his serum sodium was measured at 142 mEq/L. A spot urine sample was obtained to assess for possible acute kidney injury. His urine creatinine was 120 mg/dL, and the urine sodium content in the same sample measured 15 mEq/L, both of which gave important clues about his renal handling of solutes under the current conditions. Although there was no overt sign of infection, additional tests were ordered to rule out subtle pyelonephritis or other urinary tract pathology that can sometimes present atypically with reduced output and nonspecific complaints. The patient’s other lab work, including complete blood count and hepatic function tests, was unremarkable, and a basic metabolic panel demonstrated that the main abnormalities resided in the indices related to renal function and electrolyte balance. Imaging studies, including a renal ultrasound performed shortly after arrival, showed no structural abnormalities such as hydroureter or hydronephrosis that might suggest an obstructive process, and the kidneys appeared of normal size for his age. A focused review of his cardiovascular status showed no significant valvular disease or peripheral edema to suggest a sudden cardiac etiology contributing to fluid mismanagement. The clinical impression was that this individual was likely experiencing acute impairment in renal function in the context of decreased intake and possibly compromised renal perfusion, though other causes had yet to be excluded. Further investigations were aimed at discerning whether his renal dysfunction was related to an intrinsic parenchymal process or an alteration in perfusion to the kidneys. Previous outpatient visits did not reveal any longstanding proteinuria or hematuria, and he had not complained of any prior episodes of acute kidney problems. He expressed concern about his overall decrease in urine production and accompanying fatigue, and he was counseled that additional targeted diagnostic workup would be required to elucidate the precise cause of his renal issues.",What is the patient's Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)?

563,40,Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa),lab test,decimal,pmc-7327389-1,Extracted,"A 69-year-old male was admitted due to quadriparesis via the emergency room (ER). He had multiple comorbidities: old pulmonary tuberculosis, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. His medications included spironolactone, glimepiride, metformin, amlodipine, and telmisartan. Two weeks earlier, however, he was diagnosed with pulmonary aspergillosis and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation at the outpatient department (OPD). A pulmonologist and a cardiologist prescribed oral voriconazole (200 mg twice a day) and dronedarone (400 mg twice a day), respectively. 
At admission, the patient's blood pressure was 124/52 mmHg, and no focal neurologic deficit was noted on physical examination. Serum sodium was 133 mmol/L, potassium was 8.0 mmol/L, calcium was 9.3 mg/dL, phosphorus was 4.7 mg/dL, and creatinine was 1.57 mg/dL. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation and left bundle branch block (). The severe hyperkalemia appeared to be caused by spironolactone and telmisartan coadministration, and these offending agents were discontinued. In addition, hyperkalemia was antagonized by intravenous calcium gluconate and was corrected by administration of intravenous insulin lispro and calcium polystyrene sulfonate. His proteinuria was persistent, reaching 1,131 mg/d in a 24 h urine collection. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.007, pH 5.0, albumin 1+, red blood cells 5–9/high power field (HPF), and white blood cells 3-4/HPF. Additional lab values included a urine sodium of 19.35 mmol/L and urine creatinine of 84.31 mg/dL. Because monoclonal gammopathy was suggested from serum and urine protein electrophoresis, a kidney biopsy was performed. Light microscopic examination revealed two global scleroses among 17 glomeruli sampled and showed marked mesangial expansion with mesangial hypercellularity and global thickening of the glomerular capillary walls. Immunofluorescence revealed lambda light chain-restricted glomerular mesangial and linear capillary loop staining (). Electron microscopic evaluation showed vague, fine granular, amorphous deposits in the mesangium and along the peripheral capillary walls. These pathologic findings were compatible with light chain deposition disease. The immunofixation test revealed that heavy and light chains were IgG and λ, respectively. However, no osteolytic lesions were found, and the bone marrow was normocellular. Thus, he was discharged without specific treatment while maintaining voriconazole.
Nine days later, the patient was readmitted because of gait disturbance and dysarthria. Brain imaging revealed no acute lesion. Bradyarrhythmia was noted (), and acute hemodialysis was undertaken to treat both hypercalcemia (11.7 mg/dL) and hyperkalemia (7.5 mmol/L). Urine sodium was 127 mmol/L, potassium was 19 mmol/L, chloride was 125 mmol/L, creatinine was 36 mg/dL, and osmolality was 372 mOsm/kg H2O. The transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) was calculated to be 2.02, and arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.354, pCO2 38.5 mmHg, pO2 110 mmHg, and HCO3− 20.9 mmol/L. Results of the following endocrine tests were unremarkable: plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone concentration, intact-PTH, and stimulated cortisol. Vitamin D levels were low, and PTH-related peptide was undetectable. We considered the possibility of voriconazole-induced hyperkalemia; therefore, voriconazole was discontinued. Because the follow-up ECG showed the atrial fibrillation was resolved, dronedarone was discontinued. At discharge, his serum sodium was 135 mmol/L, potassium was 4.1 mmol/L, calcium was 9.5 mg/dL, phosphorus was 3.7 mg/dL, protein was 7.5 g/dL, albumin was 3.1 g/dL, and creatinine was 0.69 mg/dL.
Approximately one month later, the patient was readmitted because of massive hemoptysis and required bronchial artery embolization. The pulmonologist prescribed itraconazole to treat pulmonary aspergillosis. One week later, however, itraconazole was switched to a reduced dose (100 mg twice a day) of voriconazole. In the meantime, antihypertensives were switched to manidipine and propranolol.
Sixteen days after voriconazole had been resumed, serum potassium had increased to 5.7 mmol/L, and one day later, the patient again visited the ER because of chest tightness. His serum sodium was 130 mmol/L, potassium was 8.0 mmol/L, calcium was 8.9 mg/dL, phosphorus was 5.8 mg/dL, and creatinine was 1.63 mg/dL. An ECG suggested complete atrioventricular block (), and he recovered normal sinus rhythm after acute hemodialysis (). Once again, voriconazole was replaced with itraconazole (200 mg once a day). Manidipine was discontinued because of the potential drug interaction between azole antifungals and calcium channel blockers. Plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone were 0.26 (normal, 0.32–1.84) ng/mL/h and 3.0 (normal, 4.2–20.9) ng/dL, respectively. No further electrolyte disturbances were noted during the admission for three weeks, and his final follow-up laboratory findings were: serum sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 4.4 mmol/L, calcium 9.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.4 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.85 mg/dL.",What is the patient's Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)?

572,40,Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa),lab test,decimal,7,Synthetic,"A 67-year-old man presented with a three-day history of markedly reduced urine output and intermittent nausea, accompanied by increasing fatigue and a sense of overall weakness. He noted that his oral fluid intake had been lower than usual due to poor appetite and occasional feelings of queasiness, and he had experienced a few episodes of mild dizziness when standing up quickly. He has a known history of hypertension, managed with several medications, although he admits that he has occasionally missed doses over the past few months. He reports no significant changes to his usual medications and denies recent use of any new over-the-counter agents. Upon arrival, he appeared frail and somewhat lethargic, with dry mucous membranes and decreased skin turgor suggesting some degree of volume depletion or inadequate fluid intake. His vital signs revealed a borderline low blood pressure and a slightly elevated heart rate, which raised concerns about his intravascular volume status. Cardiac auscultation identified a distant rhythm consistent with his known hypertensive background, without any distinct murmurs or gallops. He denied active chest discomfort but reported a mild sense of breathlessness when performing minimal exertion. He also denied any significant edema in his lower extremities, though careful inspection suggested potential mild swelling that could not be conclusively distinguished from his usual baseline. Physical examination of his abdomen was largely benign, with no guarding or rebound tenderness, although he did report a vague feeling of pressure in his lower back. He has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia but reports no worsening of voiding symptoms, though the considerable reduction in urine volume is markedly different from his typical bladder habits. Basic laboratory work at the time of presentation demonstrated a serum creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, elevated from his reported baseline near 1.0 mg/dL, indicating a possible acute change in renal function. Additional tests revealed a serum sodium level of 140 mEq/L, which sits near the middle of normal limits. Further urinalysis and related measurements showed that his urine sodium concentration was 25 mEq/L, prompting consideration of possible prerenal versus intrinsic etiologies for this acute drop in output. A notably high measure of urine creatinine, registering at 145 mg/dL, reflected the concentrated nature of his urine during collection. He currently remains oliguric, producing only small volumes of dark, concentrated fluid despite efforts at gentle oral hydration prior to arrival. He denies flank pain or hematuria, and there is no visible sediment when his urine is observed. His outpatient records mention episodes of dizziness in the past associated with inadequate fluid intake, but there is no clear documentation of chronic kidney disease or prior episodes like this. He does, however, acknowledge a prior incident of dehydration during a particularly hot summer week two years ago that prompted an emergency visit for intravenous fluids. As part of the present evaluation, a review of his medication regimen is underway to identify any agents that could contribute to altered renal perfusion, especially since he recalls starting a new antihypertensive approximately one year ago. He has no reports of rash, arthralgias, or fever, reducing the likelihood of systemic inflammatory or infectious processes, and he denies recent travels or changes in diet aside from the reduced intake driven by nausea. A focused cardiac and pulmonary assessment remains unremarkable aside from his known hypertension and mild tachycardia, with chest imaging thus far revealing no acute abnormalities. Plans are in place for additional tests, including renal imaging, to rule out obstruction, and for careful monitoring of fluid balance to better distinguish between prerenal factors and an intrinsic renal cause. He expresses concern about the sudden change in his urine output and wonders if modifications to his antihypertensive therapy or any recent variation in his medication adherence could have contributed to this presentation. He is cooperative with further diagnostic steps, acknowledging the importance of timely identification of potentially reversible factors.

564,40,Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa),lab test,decimal,pmc-6051943-1,Extracted,"A 26-year-old man was admitted with known hypokalemia. He reported a 3-year history of nausea, vomiting, and diffuse muscle weakness. He complained of nausea and epigastric fullness in the absence of any identifiable organic gastrointestinal pathology, and his symptoms were known to subside after self-induced vomiting. Although he reported a normal appetite, he was known to vomit frequently, particularly after a large meal. He had been diagnosed with hypokalemia and had been treated with potassium supplements at a previous hospital. However, because of persistent nausea and vomiting, he was transferred to our hospital for evaluation of hypokalemia. His medical and family histories were unremarkable, and he did not report the use of medications such as diuretics and/or herbal medication. Physical examination upon admission showed he was 175 cm tall and weighed 44.5 kg, which indicated a weight loss from his previous weight of 58 kg over the previous 2 years. His body mass index was 14.53 kg/m2. Blood pressure was 100/60mmHg, pulse rate was 67/min, respiratory rate was 20/min, and his body temperature was 37.0℃.
Initial serum electrolyte testing showed the following: sodium 133 mEq/L, potassium 2.6 mEq/L, chloride 72 mEq/L, and total carbon dioxide 50mEq/L. Calcium/phosphorus were 11.2/4.1mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine were 21.9/1.98mg/dL, the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 43.6mL/min/1.73m2, serum magnesium was 2.0mg/dL, blood glucose was 93mg/dL, and hemoglobin was 12.0 g/dL. Total cholesterol was 285mg/dL, serum protein/albumin were 8.1/5.3 g/dL. Thyroid and adrenal function tests, as well as serum renin and aldosterone levels were all within reference range. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.557, partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 65.8mmHg, and bicarbonate was 58.5 mEq/L. Urinary levels of sodium/potassium/chloride (Na/K/Cl) were 95/73.2/47mEq/L, respectively, his urinary creatinine measured 111.12mg/dL, and the trans-tubular potassium gradient was 17. Urinalysis showed the following findings: blood -, albumin ±, glucose -, and ketones -. Upper endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography showed no abnormalities. The SLC12A3 gene mutation test for Gitelman syndrome was observed to be negative. He was diagnosed with chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis with kidney failure and treated with saline hydration, potassium supplementation, and spironolactone. Serum potassium increased to 3.0mEq/L; however, his nausea and vomiting persisted.
A renal biopsy was performed for the evaluation of renal dysfunction. Microscopically, interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration was identified. Renal tubular epithelial cells showed mild nuclear variation with conspicuous nucleoli and cytoplasmic vacuolization, indicating regenerative changes after acute tubular necrosis. Several foci of dystrophic calcification were identified among the tubular epithelial cells. A few shrunken glomeruli were observed suggesting ischemic damage; however, most glomeruli revealed no definitive abnormalities such as mesangial cell proliferation, segmental sclerosis, and/or deposition of immune complexes (). The patient showed an improvement in his gastrointestinal symptoms after treatment with mirtazapine. His serum potassium level increased to 3.5–4.4mEq/L and to date, he has been following-up at the outpatient clinic without any clinical signs and symptoms.",What is the patient's Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)?

575,40,Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa),lab test,decimal,10,Synthetic,"A 61-year-old female with a noteworthy background of osteoarthritis and mild hyperlipidemia came to the hospital with a chief complaint of markedly diminished urine output over the past three days, accompanied by generalized fatigue and intermittent lightheadedness. She recalled feeling more lethargic than usual for about a week and attributed part of it to an inadequate oral intake, as she had experienced mild gastrointestinal upset during that time. She reported no significant recent changes to her medication regimen, which includes a cholesterol-lowering agent and an occasional analgesic for joint pains. She also denied any recognized exposure to substances known to affect kidney function, though she admitted occasionally trying certain herbal products she learned about from acquaintances. On examination, she appeared tired but was able to answer questions appropriately, and her vital signs showed a mildly reduced blood pressure compared to her typical range, with a heart rate near the upper limits of normal. Her skin was notably dry, and her mucous membranes lacked their usual moisture, suggesting possible volume contraction or at least suboptimal fluid intake. She did not recall a precise measurement of her fluid intake in the days prior to admission, but she suspected it had been below her usual baseline. Abdominal examination did not reveal any significant tenderness, masses, or organomegaly, although she mentioned a vague sense of bilateral flank fullness when asked specifically about discomfort. She had no overt edema in her lower extremities, but there was a trace amount of swelling around the ankles that she had only recently noticed. Cardiopulmonary evaluation was unremarkable, with no extra heart sounds or pulmonary congestion noted, though her jugular venous pressure was somewhat low on inspection. Neurologically, she was fully alert, without focal deficits, but frequently mentioned difficulty concentrating and a sense of persistent tiredness. Laboratory testing at the time of arrival revealed a serum creatinine level measured at 2.3 mg/dL, a significant increase from her most recent outpatient baseline of around 1.0 mg/dL recorded several months prior. Her serum sodium was 144 mEq/L, landing towards the upper side of normal. She denied any major dietary shifts that might explain the electrolyte imbalance, but the value remained within plausible limits, considering her reported recent poor oral intake. Her urine studies obtained from an initial void sample showed a sodium content of 27 mEq/L. The concentration of key solutes in that same sample included a creatinine reading around 125 mg/dL, which suggested a relatively concentrated urine, potentially reflective of her volume status at presentation. Additional labs indicated mildly elevated blood urea nitrogen, elongating the picture of compromised kidney function, though she was not entirely certain about her typical baseline for that marker. She denied gross hematuria or significant changes in urine color, aside from it appearing darker over the last few days. She also expressed concern about reduced activity tolerance, stating that simple household tasks that previously posed no challenge had become tiring. She had experienced no overt chest pain, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, which lessened the likelihood of significant cardiac etiologies contributing to her current condition. There was no notable rash, no joint swelling indicating an inflammatory process, and no recent history of fever. She recounted that she had experienced a few transient dizzy spells earlier in the week, but they did not result in falls or urgent medical visits, and she simply dismissed them as dehydration. Preliminary imaging of her urinary tract showed kidneys that were of normal contour and size without evidence of obstruction. Her longstanding osteoarthritis treatment included mild analgesics and occasional physical therapy sessions, and there was no sign she had misused any potentially nephrotoxic medications. Given the acute rise in a kidney function marker from her baseline, her reduced urine volume, and her recent low appetite, her care team considered multiple causes for this abrupt change, including possible prerenal factors or a developing intrinsic process. She had yet to receive any intravenous fluids or other targeted interventions before lab work was finalized, providing an accurate representation of her status upon presentation. Her primary worry revolved around whether this decline in her kidney function would resolve, and she was open to further diagnostic procedures as needed. She was counseled that close monitoring of her urine output and serial laboratory measurements would be essential to discern whether her kidney function could recover with supportive measures and to determine if additional investigations might be warranted.",What is the patient's Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)?

949,43,Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score,risk,integer,9,Synthetic,"A 53-year-old male arrived at the emergency department in severe respiratory distress, transferred from a smaller facility where he had been placed on a form of advanced airway intervention due to his inability to maintain adequate oxygenation on minimal support. According to the paramedics, his level of alertness had declined en route, with him barely responding to painful stimuli and failing to follow instructions, suggestive of a notable reduction in mental clarity at the time of presentation. On formal neurologic assessment, his Glasgow  Coma  Score was  7. The arterial blood gas sample obtained upon arrival indicated a partial pressure of oxygen of 74  mm Hg range in the face of a supplemental oxygen concentration of 28 % (FiO₂ 0.28), underscoring the severity of his respiratory compromise. In addition, he received a specialized mode of respiratory assistance that provides a constant level of increased pressure in his airways, presumably to help improve alveolar recruitment. Clinicians initiated dopamine at  4 mcg/kg/min to support or enhance cardiac output in this critically ill individual. Laboratory evaluations at the time of his admission showed a platelet count in the 180,000 µL, which was neither severely depressed nor indicative of pronounced risk for hemorrhage. His bilirubin level measured at 2.2 mg/dL, which corresponded with the presence of subtle jaundice noted on examination and raised questions about underlying hepatic dysfunction or possible hemolysis. While no overt chronic liver disease had been previously documented, he did endorse occasional alcohol use and had recently complained of a decreased appetite. Further labs revealed that his renal status was around the upper range of normal for his demographic, with a creatinine reading of 1 mg/dL, and his reported daily urine output—based on a measurement conducted before any significant therapeutic intervention—was  1800 milliliters, suggesting reasonable kidney performance despite his acute presentation. Clinicians performed a careful review of his cardiovascular findings, affirming that he had a stable pulse and no signs of profound shock, which was reassuring considering the severity of his neurologic and pulmonary problems. Imaging of his thorax pointed to possible bilateral processes, although the precise etiology was not immediately evident, prompting further investigations to rule out a severe infectious or inflammatory trigger. The decision was made to keep him on the advanced airway modality with continuous baseline pressure to optimize oxygenation while allowing for close monitoring of his neurological status, which was compromised enough to warrant concern about airway protection without mechanical support. His depressed consciousness, accompanied by limited eye opening and minimal vocalization, raised the urgency to secure imaging of his central nervous system to exclude any acute intracranial insult. Given the combination of mild hyperbilirubinemia, moderate respiratory failure, and depressed cognition, he was rapidly triaged to a higher level of care for immediate supervision, with further diagnostic exploration aimed at identifying the underlying cause of his multifaceted presentation. Despite the serious nature of his condition, his stable systemic blood pressure, acceptable platelet figure, and apparently preserved renal output offered some hope that his circulatory and renal systems were not yet in grave jeopardy, though the team recognized the potential for rapid changes in this precarious scenario. The tentative plan included aggressive investigation for possible infections, supportive management of his respiratory compromise, and continuous vigilance over his cardiovascular parameters to ensure that his perfusion remained adequate and that no additional hemodynamic agents beyond the single moderate‑dose infusion would be necessary. Additional laboratory panels, cultures, and specialized imaging would help clarify whether his elevated bilirubin stemmed from an acute infectious hepatic insult, hemolytic process, or another hepatic issue altogether. Careful neurological checks were also deemed essential to track any improvement or worsening of his severely lowered awareness level, in the hope that progress could be made once the probable underlying trigger for his respiratory decompensation was identified and addressed.",What is the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score?,"{'PaO2': [74, 'mm Hg'], 'FiO2': [28, '%'], 'On mechanical ventilation': True, 'Continuous positive airway pressure': True, 'Platelet count': [180000, 'µL'], 'Glasgow Coma Score': 7, 'Bilirubin': [2.2, 'mg/dL'], 'Hypotension': False, 'DOPamine': [4, 'mcg/kg/min'], 'creatinine': [1.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Urine Output': [1800, 'mL/day']}",9,9,9,"The criteria for the SOFA Score are shown below:

948,43,Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score,risk,integer,8,Synthetic,"A 62-year-old female with a past history of type  2 diabetes and longstanding mild renal insufficiency presented to the hospital after three days of progressive confusion, severe fatigue, and intermittent lightheadedness. According to her relatives, she had become increasingly lethargic, barely responding to basic questions and often requiring repeated prompts to open her eyes. On examination, her responsiveness was notably diminished; she did not initiate speech unless vigorously stimulated, and her eyes remained closed most of the time unless a painful stimulus was applied. Her verbal output was limited to short, slurred phrases, indicating a substantial decline in her usual mental status. She also appeared to be breathing more rapidly than normal, although her chest movements were symmetric and no overt abnormalities were detected on initial auscultation. After a sample of arterial blood was drawn, analysis revealed that her partial pressure of oxygen measured 89 mm  Hg, and she was receiving an inspired oxygen fraction of 38 % (FiO₂ 0.38), which was instituted given her apparent respiratory distress. Her Glasgow  Coma  Score (GCS) was  8. Her blood pressure upon arrival measured in the 76/52 mm Hg range, representing a marked drop from her typically well‑controlled readings documented in outpatient clinic notes. Her peripheral pulses were faint, and her hands felt cool to the touch, prompting immediate concern for inadequate perfusion. In response to her poor pressures, the clinical team initiated norEPINEPHrine at  0.06 mcg/kg/min to support arterial tone. Additional vital signs showed a fluctuating heart rate in the triple digits, accompanied by regular but labored respirations that required close observation in the acute environment. Laboratory findings pointed toward several abnormalities at the time of her initial assessment. Her platelet count was 175 000 µL, consistent with slight downward shifts from her reported baseline but not reaching a level that would routinely raise concern for hemorrhagic complications. Furthermore, liver function testing demonstrated a total bilirubin of  1.3 mg/dL, although physical examination did not identify overt jaundice. Her renal function appeared to be worsened compared to her usual status, with a serum creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, consistent with at least a moderate acute insult on top of her known chronic issues. Her urine output over the previous 24  hours was 700 mL, and staff noted the possibility that her reduced fluid intake in the preceding days or a developing infectious process could have impaired her kidney output. Although she was poorly communicative, her temperature was not profoundly elevated; yet the team remained suspicious of an underlying infection given the acuity of her presentation and the gradual decline in mental clarity. Beyond her blood pressure challenge, no additional circulatory measures were noted at the time of her arrival, and her veins were somewhat collapsed, suggesting the need for immediate fluid resuscitation to accompany the medication infusion already started to maintain perfusion. She did not exhibit any episodes of overt bleeding, although bruises and mild abrasions on her arms drew some attention in light of her borderline platelet levels. Efforts were directed toward identifying a possible source of infection by obtaining cultures and imaging, while also providing supportive therapy to address her rising creatinine and reduced urine volumes. Her respiratory status called for supplemental oxygen, yet she remained able to breathe spontaneously, albeit with shallow, somewhat rapid respiratory efforts that demanded close monitoring. She had not received any advanced breathing interventions prior to posting these measurements, and her initial chest imaging did not reveal an obvious consolidation nor extensive fluid overload, though the final radiologic interpretations were pending. Despite her depressed level of arousal, she demonstrated occasional agitation when staff attempted to insert intravenous lines, indicating that she retained some protective reflexes even as she struggled to remain awake. The medical team planned frequent rechecks of her neurological status, with concerns that her confusion could reflect a metabolic derangement, an infectious encephalopathy, or a superimposed toxic‑metabolic disturbance. While her coagulation parameters were not dramatically abnormal, clinicians remained vigilant for any further hematologic compromise that might occur alongside the decline in multiple organ functions. Given her relatively elevated bilirubin level, they also contemplated possible hepatic stressors, though her sclera did not show obvious yellow discoloration on gross exam. With multiple sites of potential compromise—including diminished brain responsiveness, threatened hemodynamics, and an acute on chronic renal issue—the immediate priority was to stabilize her respiratory adequacy, maintain organ perfusion through cautious fluid management and vasopressor titrations, and investigate any underlying infectious or inflammatory cause. Her presentation underscored the need for intensive monitoring, with the hope that early targeted interventions would avert further deterioration and facilitate a gradual return toward her baseline status.",What is the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score?,"{'PaO2': [89, 'mm Hg'], 'FiO2': [38, '%'], 'Continuous positive airway pressure': False, 'Platelet count': [175000, 'µL'], 'Glasgow Coma Score': 8, 'Bilirubin': [1.3, 'mg/dL'], 'Hypotension': True, 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [76, 'mm Hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [52, 'mm Hg'], 'norEPINEPHrine': [0.06, 'mcg/kg/min'], 'creatinine': [1.6, 'mg/dL'], 'Urine Output': [700, 'mL/day'], 'On mechanical ventilation': False}",10,10,10,"The criteria for the SOFA Score are shown below:

950,43,Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score,risk,integer,10,Synthetic,"A 74‑year‑old male presented with profound confusion and severely diminished responsiveness, prompting immediate evaluation for possible acute multi‑organ compromise. According to bystanders who accompanied him, he had been increasingly somnolent over the preceding two days, becoming nearly unarousable by the time of hospital arrival. Initial assessment revealed that he was breathing without the assistance of a tube or other advanced apparatus but required supplemental oxygen at a concentration of 33 %—roughly one‑third above ambient levels. Despite this added oxygen, his arterial sample showed a partial pressure of 68 mm Hg, indicating sub‑optimal gas exchange. He had dangerously low arterial pressure on arrival, with measurements of 76/32 mm Hg;  he was started on an intravenous medication at 5 mcg/kg/min of DOPamine along with 0.07 mcg/kg/min norEPINEPHrine. Of note, two other intravenous therapies that are sometimes considered when significant cardiac or vascular support is necessary were not added at this time. Laboratory evaluations performed urgently revealed several abnormalities. His platelet count was found to be 200 000 / µL, which remains within acceptable limits yet will be watched closely in the context of possible systemic dysfunction. Another noteworthy finding was a total bilirubin level measured at 2.5 mg/dL, signifying a degree of hepatobiliary distress that could stem from either pre‑existing liver vulnerability or a more acute systemic insult. Renal indicators likewise raised concern: his serum creatinine was 2.4 mg/dL, suggesting precipitous kidney stress or an acute‑on‑chronic injury. Despite this worrisome finding, he managed to produce 2 000 mL of urine over a day’s time before presentation, showing that at least some degree of filtration and fluid excretion was continuing, though the ultimate viability of this function remained in question. Clinicians were particularly alarmed by his severely decreased cognitive responses. They noted that he did not reliably open his eyes spontaneously, rarely demonstrated coherent verbal skills, and occasionally withdrew from painful stimuli but did not exhibit the purposeful resistance that might be expected in a less compromised state, giving a GCS of 9. This level of unresponsiveness could carry implications for airway protection and further respiratory compromise, so the care team kept him under constant observation in a setting equipped to intervene quickly. Despite his markedly reduced alertness, he exhibited no major indications of widespread bleeding tendencies, maintaining an intact platelet count without unwarranted bruising or bleeding from venipuncture sites. There was no obvious sign of shock as determined by standard circulatory parameters, yet the mild infusion of two intravenous agents to bolster cardiac output and systemic blood flow seemed prudent given his risk factors. Imaging studies were ordered to explore possible causes of acute mental status change; early suspicions included metabolic derangements, hepatic dysfunction, occult infection, or other inflammatory triggers that could precipitate such a presentation. In the absence of overt respiratory failure requiring a breathing apparatus, he was allowed to breathe spontaneously with carefully titrated supplemental oxygen. Healthcare providers remained especially mindful of his advanced years and unknown baseline organ performance, contemplating whether his kidney dysfunction might be longstanding or newly emergent. Additional diagnostic steps, including a thorough review of historical labs and potential nephrotoxic exposures, were initiated. Plans called for ongoing neurological checks, repeated measurements of his arterial oxygen, and close tracking of his urine output and evolving laboratory parameters. Although he displayed worrisome neurologic depression, the absence of alarmingly low blood pressure and the presence of continued, albeit possibly tenuous, urine production offered some measure of cautious optimism. The immediate treatment efforts aimed to stabilize oxygenation, preserve end‑organ perfusion with carefully dosed intravenous medications, and identify any factors that could explain or exacerbate hepatic and renal strain. No significant prior medical records were available at the time of his initial evaluation, which introduced another layer of complexity when formulating a definitive care plan. Nonetheless, the early provision of supportive therapies, vigilant hemodynamic monitoring, and timely diagnostic workup stood as the principal approach to prevent further deterioration. His condition at presentation underscored the gravity of severe neurologic depression, elevated bilirubin, deteriorating renal indicators, and sub‑optimal oxygen exchange, all unfolding despite a near‑normal range of blood pressure measurements. Close multidisciplinary collaboration was deemed essential to elucidate the underlying cause, tailor potential treatments, and determine the best path forward in safeguarding both his neurologic prognosis and multi‑organ function.",What is the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score?,"{'PaO2': [68, 'mm Hg'], 'FiO2': [33, '%'], 'On mechanical ventilation': False, 'Platelet count': [200000, 'µL'], 'Glasgow Coma Score': 9, 'Bilirubin': [2.5, 'mg/dL'], 'Hypotension': True, 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [76, 'mm Hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [32, 'mm Hg'], 'DOPamine': [5, 'mcg/kg/min'], 'norEPINEPHrine': [0.07, 'mcg/kg/min'], 'creatinine': [2.4, 'mg/dL'], 'Urine Output': [2000, 'mL/day']}",12,12,12,"The criteria for the SOFA Score are shown below:

955,43,Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score,risk,integer,15,Synthetic,"A 61‑year‑old male with a history of mild dietary issues and several recent days of lethargy was brought to the hospital by concerned relatives after he became nearly unresponsive and was noted to have drastically reduced urine output. According to family, he had complained of vague abdominal discomfort, increasing fatigue, and poor fluid intake over the past week, culminating in profound weakness and an inability to get out of bed on the morning of presentation. On arrival, he was breathing spontaneously but required a moderate amount of supplemental oxygen, and arterial blood sampling displayed a partial pressure of oxygen measuring at 81 mm Hg while he inhaled roughly 37 % inspired oxygen. Despite no reports of chronic pulmonary disease, his effort appeared shallow, and his oxygenation was marginal compared to typical room‑air expectations. His heart rate was slow, and his extremities felt cool to the touch, prompting an immediate blood pressure measurement that revealed a severely low reading of 78 mm Hg systolic and 46 mm Hg diastolic. He was found to be deeply unresponsive—scoring a Glasgow  Coma  Score of  3. Laboratory assessments collected before administering any standard interventions uncovered a remarkably elevated creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL, consistent with significant renal impairment or acute kidney injury, especially given his reduced daily urine volume, which had fallen to only about 500 milliliters over the preceding 24‑hour span. This decline in kidney function was of particular concern because he had previously only been noted to have slightly above‑normal readings on routine blood work. His total bilirubin level at presentation was 3.2 mg/dL, high enough to suggest either hepatic involvement or hemolysis, though no obvious external signs of severe liver disease were observed aside from mild jaundice on closer inspection of his sclera. Other hematologic parameters included a platelet concentration at 250 000 per microliter, which fell within the reference range and did not point to significant thrombocytopenia. However, even with normal platelet numbers, the possibility of broader systemic perturbations remained on the differential, given his shock‑like state and acute deterioration. Although no other continuous intravenous therapies had been employed at the time of initial evaluation, he was receiving norepinephrine at 0.11 mcg/kg/min. The patient’s abrupt mental status change, including the lack of vocalization and near‑complete absence of motor responses, prompted a thorough neurological examination and the consideration of an intracranial process, though early imaging did not demonstrate any localized lesion. Given these potentially overlapping insults—evidenced by high bilirubin, compromised kidney function, an alarmingly low pressure, and severe unresponsiveness—the clinical team rapidly broadened their workup to identify a unifying cause, such as an overwhelming infection, toxic ingestion, or severe metabolic dysfunction. His respiratory pattern, though not fully labored, remained insufficient for normal gas exchange, reinforcing the need for close observation. Despite the absence of major bruises or a bleeding history, clinicians remained alert to the possibility of coagulopathy or evolving disseminated processes, since organ function was clearly threatened in multiple domains. He had no documented history of advanced cardiac conditions, but the combination of borderline pulses and critically low readings raised the question of whether an acute cardiac event or profound volume depletion had also contributed to his current state. Ultimately, the plan at this early stage—formulated just after gathering these findings—was to ensure the airway was protected, continue supportive measures to keep his circulation stable, and pursue extensive diagnostic testing, including repeated laboratory panels and imaging studies, to uncover any treatable source of his precipitous decline. All of these findings, collected before attempts to implement additional high‑level therapies, demonstrated multifactorial compromise and underscored the urgency of recognizing and reversing the underlying pathology before further organ damage ensued.",What is the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score?,"{'PaO2': [81, 'mm Hg'], 'FiO2': [37, '%'], 'On mechanical ventilation': False, 'Platelet count': [250000, 'µL'], 'Glasgow Coma Score': 3, 'Bilirubin': [3.2, 'mg/dL'], 'Hypotension': True, 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [78, 'mm Hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [46, 'mm Hg'], 'norEPINEPHrine': [0.11, 'mcg/kg/min'], 'creatinine': [3.1, 'mg/dL'], 'Urine Output': [500, 'mL/day']}",14,14,14,"The criteria for the SOFA Score are shown below:

957,43,Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score,risk,integer,17,Synthetic,"A 69‑year‑old male arrived at the hospital complaining of several days of persistent fatigue, mild confusion, and reduced exercise tolerance. He had been living independently until recently, but neighbors noticed him becoming unusually forgetful and withdrawn over the past week. At the time of presentation, he did not require the placement of a breathing tube to secure his airway, yet he was observed to be wearing a specialized mask that delivered continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 31 %. Staff measured his arterial oxygen concentration while he was receiving that support and found a PaO₂ of 91 mm Hg, suggesting that his gas exchange, though not severely compromised, required close observation. When further examined, he displayed sluggish verbal responses and difficulty staying focused on questions, indicating a moderate degree of mental‑status impairment rather than complete unresponsiveness. Vital signs on arrival showed blood pressure at 120/76 mm Hg and a regular pulse. Laboratory testing revealed a platelet count of 125 000 /µL, modestly decreased compared with standard thresholds, though still sufficient to avoid spontaneous bleeding. Total bilirubin measured 2.9 mg/dL, prompting a search for possible hemolysis, hepatic distress, or another process that might cause such a pattern of laboratory derangements; he indeed showed slight scleral icterus. Renal studies showed a serum creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, higher than expected in a healthy adult male of his age, though not so high as to suggest end‑stage compromise. Nursing documentation confirmed a 24‑hour urine output of 1,100 mL/day, recognized as borderline yet not severely reduced, consistent with mild or moderate impairment of kidney filtration. His Glasgow  Coma  Score was 10. No widespread rash or localized infections were evident on exam, and the patient reported no recent hospitalizations or procedures, though he struggled to recall many details about his medical history during questioning. He was fully vaccinated against common respiratory pathogens, according to a relative, reducing suspicion for certain causes of acute pulmonary infection, but that possibility could not be definitively ruled out without further investigation. On physical examination, his chest revealed relatively clear breath sounds, though the CPAP mask was helping to maintain stable oxygen levels. He did not appear to be working excessively hard to breathe, and he maintained an adequate rate of ventilation without signs of accessory‑muscle use or overt fatigue. Heart sounds were generally normal, with no distinct murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal inspection was significant for mild right‑upper‑quadrant tenderness on palpation, possibly correlating with the elevated bilirubin. Neurologically, he was inconsistent in following commands and sometimes responded only after the examiner repeated questions several times, though he retained basic awareness of his identity. In the absence of focal neurologic deficits, a thorough search for electrolyte imbalances, infections, or toxic causes of his confusion was initiated. Blood cultures, imaging of his chest and abdomen, and a panel of metabolic studies were ordered, along with plans to monitor his urinary output and repeat hepatic indicators. Given his moderate ability to communicate, the care team opted for close observation rather than invasive support, while remaining vigilant for any signs of deteriorating respiratory effort or cardiovascular stability. The overall impression was of a complex interplay involving moderate neurologic dysfunction, laboratory signals of potential liver involvement, and mild renal decline, all occurring without overt circulatory collapse.",What is the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score?,"{'PaO2': [91, 'mm Hg'], 'FiO2': [31, '%'], 'On mechanical ventilation': False, 'Continuous positive airway pressure': True, 'Platelet count': [125000, 'µL'], 'Glasgow Coma Score': 10, 'Bilirubin': [2.9, 'mg/dL'], 'Hypotension': False, 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [120, 'mm Hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [76, 'mm Hg'], 'creatinine': [1.3, 'mg/dL'], 'Urine Output': [1100, 'mL/day']}",8,8,8,"The criteria for the SOFA Score are shown below:

medical history who presented to a school-based cholesterol and diabetes screening.
Her height and weight were 155 cm and 39.5 kg, respectively, and her body mass index
was at the 20th percentile for age and sex. Her vital signs were within normal
limits, her blood pressure was not elevated, and she was well-appearing. Her
screening lipid panel was within normal limits (cholesterol 125 mg/dL, high-density

Point-of-care screening HgbA1C was significant for a value of 8.5% with a repeat
value of 8.7%. The endocrinology team was consulted by phone and the patient denied
symptoms of weight loss, polydipsia, polyuria, nocturia, and polyphagia; however, a
strong family history of diabetes was reported ().
In the setting of a new diagnosis of diabetes, she was referred to the Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital Medical Center Emergency Department for further evaluation and
management. On evaluation in the emergency department additional laboratory studies
were sent to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes and evaluate its etiology. Laboratory
studies included a repeat serum HgbA1C, electrolytes, urinalysis, and an islet cell
autoantibody screen. Additionally, routine new-onset diabetes screening laboratory
tests, which included a thyroid stimulating hormone, immunoglobulin A (IgA), and
tissue transglutaminase IgA, were also sent. On laboratory evaluation, she had no
evidence of acidosis or urine ketones and a random serum glucose was within normal
limits (111 mg/dL) but with glycosuria. In the setting of a normal random serum
glucose and absence of acidosis in a well-appearing patient, she was discharged home
with the plan for close endocrine follow-up.
The repeat serum HgbA1C resulted after the patient was discharged and was elevated at
10.3% and her islet cell autoantibody screen and all other screening labs returned
as negative. On telephone follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic and a family
history obtained was significant for diabetes spanning 4 generations (see for pedigree). To
further confirm a diagnosis of new-onset diabetes an oral glucose tolerance test was
performed. Fasting glucose (89 mg/dL) and insulin (3.8 µIU/mL) were both within
normal limits. However, her oral glucose tolerance test results were consistent with
the diagnosis of diabetes, with glucose elevation to 313 mg/dL at 2 hours. In the
setting of new-onset diabetes, a negative islet cell autoantibody screen and a
family history of autosomal dominant diabetes, a diagnosis of MODY was suspected.
Confirmatory gene sequencing was sent and revealed a heterozygous mutation in HNF4A

The patient was a 34-year-old male immigrant to the US from Asia who was admitted to the medical floor of a community hospital for the management of his medical problems. He had experienced a recurrent history of anxiety and mild somatic symptoms for the past five years. He reported sleeping difficulties, panic attacks, ruminative worries, muscle tension, body weakness, and chest discomfort. The patient had a prior psychiatric history and hospitalization for anxiety and depression. He had been admitted for anxiety and depression in a free-standing health facility five years ago and had been treated with medications. He had been prescribed sertraline and quetiapine but had self-discontinued because of tolerability issues. He had continued to be anxious with mild somatic symptoms. The patient denied any manic or psychotic symptoms or any neurological symptoms. The patient also denied any suicidal or homicidal ideations. He had no history of substance use or alcohol intake. He had a family history of anxiety disorder, described as an obsessive-compulsive disorder in his mother. In 2019, he had consulted a physician who had performed an extensive medical workup. All test results were unremarkable; he was reassured and his symptoms improved. During the two to three weeks prior to the current presentation, his anxiety and somatic symptoms had recurred and had subsequently worsened. He was then admitted for further investigation.
Examination
The mental status examination revealed a young man who was neat and well-groomed. He was cooperative, calm, and made appropriate eye contact. His speech was normal. He described his mood as anxious and his affect was constricted. His thought process was normal and linear. There was no suicidal or homicidal ideation. No delusions or hallucinations were reported. He was awake, alert, and oriented to time, place, people, and events. His judgment and insight were fair.

He underwent a 12-lead electrocardiogram, which showed a ventricular rate of 80 beats/minute (reference range: 60-100 beats/minute), atrial rate of 80 beats/minute (reference range: 60-100 beats/minute), PR interval of 148 milliseconds (reference range: 120-200 milliseconds), QRS duration of 94 milliseconds (reference range: 80-100 milliseconds), QT interval of 350 milliseconds (reference range: 360-430 milliseconds), and QTC calculation (Bazett) of 403 milliseconds (reference range: ≤440 milliseconds) with normal sinus rhythm.
Other medical workups done revealed thyroid-stimulating hormone of 2.398 uIU/mL (reference range: 0.35-5.5 uIU/mL), hemoglobin A1c of 5.6% (reference range: <5.7%), and urinalysis showing no ketones or proteins. Lipid profile showed cholesterol of 182 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: <200 milligrams per deciliter), high-density lipoprotein of 39 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: <40 milligrams per deciliter), and a slightly elevated triglyceride of 196 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: <150 milligrams per deciliter). His basic metabolic panel was as follows: sodium of 140 millimoles per liter (reference range: 136-145 millimoles per liter), potassium of 4.1 millimoles per liter (reference range: 3.6-5.2 millimoles per liter), chloride of 104 millimoles per liter (reference range: 98-106 millimoles per liter), glucose of 93 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 70-100 milligrams per deciliter), calcium of 9.3 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 8.5-10.5 milligrams per deciliter), phosphorus of 4.0 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 3.4-4.5 milligrams per deciliter), blood urea nitrogen of 9 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 7-20 milligrams per deciliter), and creatinine of 1.0 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 0.84-1.21 milligrams per deciliter). His complete blood count revealed a hematocrit of 48.9% (reference range: 38.3-48.6%), mean corpuscular volume of 84.7 femtoliters (reference range: 80-96 femtoliters), and red cell distribution width of 12.5% (reference range: 11.8-14.5%). All of these results were unremarkable. Also, an MRI of the brain without contrast was unremarkable. His vitamin B12 was unremarkable as well: 337 picograms per milliliter (reference range: 160-950 picograms per milliliter).
Both the hospitalist and cardiologist cleared him for any medical issues. Despite this reassurance, he got very upset and booked a flight to his home country to have a second opinion to validate his illness.",What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

On admission, her general appearance was acutely ill and generally edematous. A physical examination revealed that her blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, her heart rate was 90/min, her respiratory rate was 22/min, and her body temperature was 36.5℃. Her breathing sounds were clear, and her heartbeat was regular without murmur. A subsequent examination of her lower limbs showed asymmetric bilateral pretibial pitting edema predominantly in the left lower limb. In contrast, the right lower limb was less edematous and had very weak popliteal and pedal pulses. Delayed capillary refilling was also found in the right toes. The Homan's sign was negative.
Serum laboratory findings at admission were as follows: white blood cell count of 5,300/mm3, hematocrit of 39.5% with hemoglobin of 13.1 g/dl, and platelet count of 286,000/mm3. The serum sodium concentration was 141 mEq/L, the potassium concentration was 4.1 mEq/L, the chloride concentration was 104 mEq/L, and total CO2 was 28 mEq/L. The blood urea nitrogen concentration was 12.1 mg/dl, the creatinine concentration was 0.86 mg/dl, the serum total protein concentration was 4.3 g/dl, the albumin concentration was 2.2 g/dl, the total cholesterol concentration was 349.4 mg/dl, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was 111 mg/dl, and the triglyceride concentration was 120.1 mg/dl. The results of liver function tests were normal. The coagulation profile showed an activated partial thromboplastin time of 32.0 s, prothrombin time of 9.7 s, anti-thrombin III value of 82% (70-120%), protein C activity of 143% (70-130%), and protein S activity of 65% (58.7-119.2%). The anti-nuclear antibody titer was less than 1:40, the anti-double-stranded DNA titer was 30.9 IU/ml, the C3 level was 158 mg/dl, and the C4 level was 19 mg/dl. Anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin G, anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin M, and lupus anticoagulant were all negative. Urinalysis revealed 3+ proteinuria (spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 10.9 g/g creatinine; spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 7,406.2 mg/g creatinine) and trace hematuria (1-3 red blood cells/high-power field). To investigate the etiology of nephrotic syndrome, an urgent renal biopsy was performed.
Thereafter, although she had no risk factors for thrombosis such as immobilization, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, morbid obesity, or a recent orthopedic or gynecologic surgery, to rule out arterial thrombosis of the right lower extremity, lower extremity computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed. The CT imaging revealed that the right superficial femoral artery was occluded and there was no identifiable proximal source of thromboembolism in other large arteries (). On the basis of these CT angiographic findings, right lower extremity angiography was performed, which revealed a total occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery (). For the treatment of this condition, balloon dilatation was initially tried at the distal superficial femoral artery but failed. Hence, thrombectomy was performed with the Fogarty balloon catheter and the thrombi were successfully aspirated. After the interventional treatment, a good distal arterial flow was reestablished (). Thereafter, warfarin (5 mg/day) as an anticoagulant and corticosteroid treatments were initiated.
Subsequent transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic studies showed no evidence of intracardiac thrombus, vegetation, or other structural abnormalities including patent foramen ovale. Quantitation of proteinuria was confirmed by using a 24-hour urine collection that showed 10.2 g/day of protein excretion and 7.8 g/day of albumin excretion, respectively. Afterwards, with administration of warfarin and corticosteroid, the patient had nearly completely recovered from the edema and claudication and was discharged. The renal pathologic results were consistent with minimal change disease ( and ). Two months after discharge, her urine protein-to-creatinine ratio decreased to less than 0.1 g/g creatinine, her serum albumin level was maintained at 4.1 g/dl, and she had no further symptoms or signs of arterial thrombosis.",What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

She was a teacher of mathematics and her symptoms initially developed during a lecture. She had no past medical history of collagen tissue disease or blunt trauma to the chest, was not on any medication and had a family history of hypercholesterolemia. She reported no autoimmune disease, was not pregnant or in the early post-partum period, nor did she take an oral contraceptive pill or report any history of drug abuse. She was also not menstruating at time of admission. Risk factors for coronary artery disease were not found. At presentation, her blood pressure was 116/70 mm Hg and her heart rate was 75 beats/min. Her physical examination results were within normal limits without murmurs, rubs or gallops. There were no manifestations of connective tissue disease and the hematologic, renal parameters were normal. The initial electrocardiogram showed nonspecific T wave inversion in leads III, aVF () and the initial chest X-ray was normal without cardiomegaly or pulmonary edema. Cardiac enzymes were elevated with initial serum troponin T of 0.07 mcg/L (normal <0.014 mcg/L), creatinine kinase (CK) of 138 U/L (normal <215 U/L) and CK-MB of 8.49 mcg/L (normal <3.77 mcg/L). The total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol results were 162 mg/dL (139-230 mg/dL), 33 mg/dL (48-177 mg/dL), and 64 mg/dL (40-81 mg/dL), respectively. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated normal left ventricular systolic function, with an ejection fraction of 73% and no regional wall motion abnormalities. We performed coronary angiography under suspicion of myocardial infarction. The right coronary artery (RCA) and left circumflex artery images were normal, but there was diffuse stenotic lesion of the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) with up to 80% luminal narrowing. The lesion slightly improved after intracoronary injection of nitroglycerine (). To evaluate the etiology of the stenotic lesion, in terms of spasm, atherosclerosis or other cause, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS, Boston scientific Co., CA, USA) was performed. IVUS showed an isolated dissection flap composed of all of the intima and media, including the internal elastic lamina and external elastic lamina, compressed by hematoma in the false lumen at the bifurcation edge of the mid LAD and diagonal branch. The dissection entry tear site to the false lumen was not detected on angiogram. Furthermore, this site was not clearly detected even on IVUS, and there was no communication between the false and true lumen (). Atherosclerotic change was not detected in this vessel (LAD) on the IVUS. 3.0×28 and 2.5×23 mm sized two Xience Prime stents (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were deployed over the dissection from the distal portion of the mid LAD for preventing any subsequent propagation of the dissection. Subsequent angiography revealed no residual stenosis without secondary dissection and restoration of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow (). Subsequent IVUS demonstrated a fully covered dissection lesion ().
The patient had a favorable clinical course and was discharged on aspirin, clopidogrel, beta blocker and statin.

Associated symptoms included generalized bone pain, intermittent headache, watery diarrhea, anorexia, and a home temperature recording of 105 °F. Review of systems was negative for chest pain, abdominal pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness. There was no history of pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis, or recent travel. The patient denied use of tobacco or drugs.
On arrival, vitals were as follows: temperature: 38.6 °C, heart rate: 109 beats per minute, respiratory rate 39 breaths per minute, SpO2: 57, blood pressure: 132/66 mm Hg. The patient was dyspneic and unable to speak in full sentences. On examination, breath sounds were equal, with symmetrical chest wall expansion. Cardiovascular examination showed regular rhythm, with strong and symmetrical peripheral pulses. Albeit distressed, the patient was alert and oriented, with no focal neurological deficits.
Initial workup included a chest X-ray, which revealed scattered bilateral airspace opacities. Pertinent laboratory values were as follows: sodium: 120 mEq/L (L), potassium: 4 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen: 21 mg/dL (H), and creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL (H); white blood cell: 13 900/µL (H), neutrophil %: 89.4 (H), and lymphocyte %: 5.5 (L); hemoglobin: 13.3 g/dL, platelets: 250 000/µL; and Dimer 2.74 (H), C-reactive protein: 29.32 mg/dL (H), ferritin: 826.30 ng/mL (H), lactate dehydrogenase: 1883 U/L (H), interleukin-6: 224.35 pg/mL (H), and troponin <0.019 (ng/mL). RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) nasopharyngeal swab returned positive for COVID.
The patient was managed on nonrebreather mask and nasal cannula; he received ceftriaxone, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and was enrolled in the ongoing remdesivir trial. After developing severe hypoxia on day 2 with oxygen saturation to the 60s off his non-rebreather mask, which he had removed, he was rapidly intubated. He had hypotension post-intubation which required vasopressor therapy; however, no overt shock was demonstrated. Lactate remained below 2.5, post intubation and serum creatinine remained below 0.8 mg/dL. Troponinemia worsened (0.194-0.682 ng/mL), and due to concern for acute PE, a heparin drip was initiated. The patient’s hospital course would continue with fluctuating hypoxia on ventilation while receiving heparin (intravenous), sedatives, and occasionally paralytics. He was continuously febrile and required pressor support for suboptimal blood pressures. Duplex study revealed no deep vein thrombosis in lower extremities and transthoracic echocardiography was without intracavitary thrombus.
On the morning of day 6, physical examination revealed diminished pupillary reflexes and mid-dilated pupils without corneal or oculocephalic reflexes, which persisted after withdrawing sedation. Computed tomography (CT) head revealed large ischemic infarcts involving bilateral occipital, left parietal, right temporal, and right frontal lobes with downward herniation into basal cisterns ().

He first went to a local clinic and was treated with “anti-inflammatory drugs (the specific name is unknown)”, but his symptoms became more severe and rapidly progressive. One day before admission, the patient started having aggravated dyspnea, listlessness, and difficulty talking while lying down, then this patient presented to our emergency room (ER).
The physical exam revealed the following: T 36°C, P 82bpm, RR 28/min, BP 107/64mmHg, SpO2 72%, WBC 20.36×10^9/L, N 18.31×10^9/L; arterial blood gas (ABG) showed PH 7.12, PO2 55mmHg, PCO2 56mmHg, SaO2 85%, Lactate 4.4mmol/L, BE-11.7mmol/L; BUN 18.1mmol/L, creatinine 166umol/L; BNP 249.83pg/mL with peripheral cyanosis and bilateral wheezing. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a dense consolidation site in the right lung with scattered shadows in both lungs, accompanying by mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, the CT results indicated the infection lesion (). He had been healthy previously, but he was a smoker with a 30-year history. He did not use illicit drugs and had no known allergies to medications. He worked as a farmer and have no family history. He was diagnosed as follows: 1. Severe pneumonia 2. Sepsis 3. Septic shock 4. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) 5. Type II respiratory failure 6. Heart failure 7. Acute renal insufficiency 8. Metabolic acidosis 9. Chronic bronchitis.
Laboratory examinations were supplemented and the results were as follows (August 31, 2019): Blood routine: neutrophil count 7.29×10^9/L, lymphocyte count 0.97×10^9/L, monocyte count 0.82×10^9/L, neutrophil percentage 79.2%, lymphocyte percentage 10.5%, red blood cell count 3.01×10^12/L, hemoglobin 86 g/L, hematocrit 0.28 L/L, mean corpuscular hemoglobin 305 g/L, platelet distribution width 9.2fl, C-reactive protein (CRP) 106.44 mg/L; hepatorenal function: ALT 15U/L, AST 13U/L, Creatinine 75umol/L. Orotracheal intubation was applied to help the patient’s respiration, assisting with the PB840 ventilator. Combined with the examination results of chest CT, the patient was provided with imipenem and cilastatin sodium 1.0g q12h, linezolid 0.6g q12h, and moxifloxacin 0.4g qd for anti-infection therapy. After a 3-day treatment, this patient still had a high fever with a maximum body temperature of 38.5°C. Continuous invasive mechanical ventilation was performed to assist the respiration, meanwhile, continuous vasoactive drugs and intravenous nutrition support were given to him.
Sputum cultures were collected and Gram stain revealed no squamous epithelial cells, few neutrophils, and Gram-negative rods. Within one day, sputum sample results showed P. aeruginosa and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (). Besides, fiberscope secretion cultures showed P. aeruginosa, which is sensitive to amikacin, gentamicin and piperacillin sodium and tazobactam sodium, intermediate to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime, but resistant to imipenem and meropenem (). Based on the culture results, we changed the treatment strategy to the combination of polymyxin B (50IU, q12h) and amikacin (0.6g, qd) for 30 days, instead of imipenem (1g q12h) and cilastatin sodium (500mg, q12h).
The patient’s body temperature was back to 37°C, measured by a clinical thermometer for armpit use for 10 minutes. His cough was significantly alleviated with white viscous sputum.

1. Confusion: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point
2. BUN >19 mg/dL (>7 mmol/L urea): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point
3. Respiratory Rate ≥30: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point
4. Systolic BP <90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤60 mmHg: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point
5. Age ≥65: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point

The total CURB-65 score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.

The CURB-65 score is current at 0 points.
The patient is 67 years old. The patient's age is greater than or equal to 65 years, and so we add 1 point to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
Whether the patient has confusion is not reported in the note. Hence, we assume this to be false, and so 0 points are added to the score, making the current total 1.
The concentration of BUN is 18.1 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of BUN from mmol to mg. The mass of BUN is 18.1 mmol. To convert 18.1 mmol of BUN to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 18.1 mmol BUN * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.0181 mol BUN. To convert from mol BUN to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.0181 mol BUN * 28.02 g/mol = 0.50716 g BUN. To convert 0.50716 g of BUN to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.50716 g BUN * 1000.0 mg/g = 507.16 mg BUN. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 507.16 mg BUN/10.0 dL = 50.716 mg BUN/dL. The concentration value of 18.1 mmol BUN/L converts to 50.716 mg BUN/dL. The patient's BUN concentration is greater than 19 mg/dL and so we add 1 point to score making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The patient's respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 2.
The patient's systiolic blood pressure is 107 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 64 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg. Because neither of these statements are true, 0 points are added to score, keeping the current total to 2.

542,45,CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity,risk,integer,pmc-7038555-1,Extracted,"An 18-year-old Black female who had been diagnosed with SCD in childhood, subsequently suffering frequent pain crises and undergoing repeated transfusions, presented to the emergency room with a 21-day history of progressive lower limb oedema accompanied by dyspnoea and orthopnoea. In addition, she reported a 3-day history of severe chest pain, together with a productive cough and fever as high as 38 °C. She reported no reduction in urine volume and no recent history of skin infection or tonsillitis. On physical examination, she was found to be very pallid and normotensive (blood pressure, 130/80 mmHg), with a heart rate of 104 bpm, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air, as well as being found to have developed anasarca. One month prior, she had undergone outpatient laboratory tests, which had shown that her renal function was normal—with a serum creatinine concentration of 0.75 mg/dl and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as determined by the Chronic Kidney Disease–Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD–EPI) equation, of 134.9 ml/min/1.73 m2—urine analysis showing no haematuria or proteinuria.
Blood tests performed at admission to the emergency room revealed the following: haemoglobin, 6.1 g/dl; haematocrit, 18.8%; haptoglobin, < 10 mg/dl; reticulocyte fraction, 6.11%; no schistocytes; lactate dehydrogenase, 433 U/L; indirect bilirubin, 0.36 mg/dl; leucocyte count, 18,820 cells/mm3; neutrophil count, 13,630 cells/mm3; lymphocyte count, 2790 cells/mm3; platelet count, 622;000 cells/mm3; and BUN, 29 mg/dl. The patient showed signs of hyperfiltration, including a serum creatinine concentration of 0.49 mg/dl and a CKD–EPI-determined eGFR of 148.5 ml/min/1.73 m2, although no hydroelectrolytic or acid-base disorders were identified. A urine sample was found to contain 100 leucocytes/field and 70 erythrocytes/field. In addition, 24-h proteinuria was 8.99 g. Further analysis of the blood samples showed the following: total proteins, 3.9 g/dl; albumin, 1.2 g/dl; globulins, 2.7 g/dl; total cholesterol, 210 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein, 114 mg/dl; high-density lipoprotein, 37 mg/dl; triglycerides, 205 mg/dl; C4, 26.1 mg/dl (normal range, 10–38 mg/dl); C3, 62 mg/dl (normal range, 73–149 mg/dl); C-reactive protein, 24.9 mg/dl (normal range, < 5 mg/dl). The serology was negative for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. The patient also tested negative for antinuclear factor, anti-DNA, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypoalbuminaemia and an anti-streptolysin O level of 816 IU/ml (normal range, < 200 IU/ml). Blood and urine cultures were negative. A chest X-ray showed mild congestion and infiltrate in the right lung base. Ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract showed that the kidneys were normal in size and appearance.
Given the clinical presentation, the diagnostic hypothesis was pneumonia and anasarca due to nephritic-nephrotic syndrome. The patient was started on ceftriaxone (1 g, twice daily). Computed tomography angiography of the chest ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism and acute chest syndrome, thus indirectly confirming the diagnosis of pneumonia.
After the infection had been controlled, the patient underwent renal biopsy. Light microscopy revealed 7 glomeruli with global endocapillary proliferation; neutrophil and macrophage infiltrate (Fig. a); synechiae in 10% of the glomeruli; occasional splitting of the glomerular basement membrane; and a preserved Bowman’s capsule. The tubules were dilated, with foci of epithelial regeneration and neutrophils within their lumina. There was focal oedema in the interstitium. The interlobular arteries had a normal aspect, with intimal proliferation in the arterioles. Immunofluorescence performed on frozen sections showed intensity of deposition of C3 (2+/3+), IgG (1+/3+), IgA (1+/3+) and lambda light chains (1+/3+), with a granular pattern, distributed diffusely throughout the capillary loop. Collectively, the histological findings were consistent with a diagnosis of APIGN accompanied by microangiopathic changes related to the underlying disease.
Treatment with a diuretic and an anti-proteinuric agent (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) was instituted, and the patient evolved to clinical improvement (normalisation of blood pressure, as well as resolution of the proteinuria and haematuria). However, the signs of hyperfiltration persisted even after resolution of the proteinuria. In the final evaluation, the serum creatinine concentration was 0.33 mg/dl and the CKD–EPI-determined eGFR was 187.8 ml/min/1.73 m2.

555,45,CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity,risk,integer,pmc-7142028-1,Extracted,"A 72-year-old female was referred to our hospital with unresolved dyspnea. She had a history of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and cerebral infarction. Two weeks before admission, dyspnea and cough developed. She was admitted to the local hospital for 10 days and was on antibiotics, including a third generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) and carbapenem (meropenem), resulting from suspected pneumonia.
At admission, she had resting dyspnea. Her body temperature was 37.1°C, heart rate 108 beats/min, blood pressure 140/80 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 84% while receiving oxygen via a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 L/min. Physical examination was notable for crackles without wheezing in the lungs and pitting edema in both lower legs. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.33, PCO2 52 mmHg, PO2 56 mmHg, HCO3- 20.6 mM/L, and O2 saturation 84.6%. Laboratory tests revealed the following values: white blood cell count 8,840/µL, hemoglobin 11.2 g/µL, platelet count 393 K/µL, total bilirubin 0.17 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 20 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 14 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 97 IU/L (range, 30–120 IU/L), gamma glutamyl transferase 46 IU/L (range, 5–39 IU/L), blood urea nitrogen 29.9 mg/dL, creatinine 0.69 mg/dL, C-reactive protein 27.57 mg/L (range, 0–5 mg/L), activated partial thrombin time 25.8 sec (range, 23–35 sec), and international normalized ratio 1.15. The level of brain natriuretic peptide and D-dimer were 1,921 pg/mL (range, 0–150 pg/mL) and 5.8 μg/mL (range, 0–0.5 μg/mL), respectively; other laboratory results were unremarkable. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110 beats/min, T wave inversion in V1-4, poor R-wave progression, and rightward axis deviation, known as ‘right ventricle (RV) strain.’
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) () showed RV dilatation with reduced systolic function, moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation (proximal isovelocity surface area radius, 5.1 mm; jet area, 7.5 cm2), left ventricle septal flattening during the systolic phase, inferior vena cava plethora, and moderate PH (pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP], 65.7 mmHg; mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 44 mmHg) without obvious atrial or ventricular septal defect. Left ventricular systolic function was preserved with an ejection fraction of 71%. Contrast–enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) with pulmonary arteriography was performed. CT showed the presence of multiple small consolidative lesions in both lung fields without evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism. A pulmonary function test showed moderate obstructive lung defect with good response to bronchodilator (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec [FEV1]/forced vital capacity [FVC] 78%, pre-FEV1 0.79 L, 43%→post-FEV1 0.99 L, 58%). A 15% decrease in the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide was noted.
Given these findings, right-sided heart failure originating from untreated asthma and acute decompensation caused by community-acquired pneumonia was suggested as the initial diagnosis. However, despite antibiotics and proper diuretic-based heart failure therapy, her dyspnea gradually worsened. On the 12th hospital day (HD), oxygen was supplied using a high flow nasal cannula (FiO2, 0.4; flow, 40 L/min), and oxygen saturation was maintained within the range of 90%–95%.
On the 14th HD, contrast-enhanced whole-body CT and ventilation/perfusion lung scans were performed to determine the cause of clinical deterioration. Chest CT showed numerous centrilobular nodules with “tree-in-bud” sign and pleural-enhancing nodules (). Abdominopelvic CT showed a 3-cm less enhancing mass with ill-defined margins located at the pancreatic head and neck region, in addition to upstream pancreatic duct dilatation (). A ventilation lung scan showed no significant decreased activity while a perfusion lung scan revealed multifocal peripherally distributed small perfusion defects in the bilateral lung fields (). Moreover, serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level was elevated 77.9 U/mL (range, 0–35 U/mL); therefore, an endoscopic ultrasonographic-guided biopsy was needed for histopathological confirmation of pancreatic cancer. However, it was impossible to obtain the biopsy due to the unbearable severe dyspnea and opposition of the patient’s family. 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography integrated with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) was performed for diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer after discussion with the Pancreatobiliary Department (). This test showed an intensive hypermetabolic mass at the pancreatic head and neck portion with multiple common hepatic, portocaval, aortocaval, hepatoduodenal, para-aortic, left common iliac, mediastinum, right lower paratracheal, and right interlobar lymph node metastases in addition to numerous tiny bilateral lung and both pleural metastases.
According to these clinical and radiologic findings, PTTM secondary to advanced pancreatic cancer was suggested as the final diagnosis. The clinical stage was TxN2M1, stage IV according to the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system []. Since the disease continuously progressed to multi-organ failure, including respiratory failure and acute kidney injury, only supportive care could be provided, and the patient died on the 27th day after diagnosis.",What is the patient's CURB-65 score?

617,46,Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease,lab test,decimal,1,Synthetic,"A 62-year-old male presents to the clinic for a routine evaluation of his overall cardiovascular health, reporting occasional fatigue but denying significant exercise intolerance or concerning chest pain. He states that his recent activities have been limited due to a busy schedule, and he acknowledges that he has not maintained a consistent regimen of physical exercise, although he tries to walk for short distances on weekends. He does not recall any significant use of tobacco in the past and expresses that he has never felt drawn to such habits. He reports no symptoms suggestive of lung problems or chronic cough. His family history is notable for several paternal relatives who experienced elevated blood pressure and related complications later in life, though he is unsure of the full extent of their conditions. He affirms that he has been taking a daily pharmacologic agent prescribed by his previous provider to manage his elevated blood pressure, which he says has helped him avoid headaches and dizziness. On examination, his body habitus is moderately overweight but not excessively so, with a waist circumference that indicates a need for further weight management counseling. His heart rate is regular, and no murmurs, gallops, or rubs are detected on auscultation. The peripheral pulses are intact, and there is no evidence of peripheral edema. Today, his systolic blood pressure reading is 145 mm Hg in the right arm seated position, which is consistent with previous values and indicates some degree of systolic elevation despite his daily therapeutic regimen. Laboratory tests obtained at this appointment reveal a total cholesterol of 230 mg/dL, which he attributes to sporadic dietary excesses, particularly a fondness for red meat dishes and limited consumption of fiber-rich foods. He admits that he has struggled with dietary restrictions, especially when attending social gatherings, but expresses willingness to improve his current habits. His high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, measured at 45 mg/dL, falls within a range that prompts re-emphasis on lifestyle modifications to optimize his lipid profile. He states that he has never been diagnosed with conditions such as chronic hyperglycemia or other metabolic derangements, and previous tests have not shown significant glucose abnormalities. He denies any prior hospital admissions for heart-related issues, has never undergone coronary catheterization or procedures, and does not have a history of chest pains associated with exertion. He does mention mild occasional twinges in his chest area when highly stressed, but these episodes are transient and not accompanied by any radiation of discomfort or associated symptoms like diaphoresis or palpitations. Current review of symptoms is otherwise unremarkable, with no persistent cough, no gastrointestinal complaints, and no changes in vision or sensation. He acknowledges the possibility that aging and inherited risk factors may contribute to his concerns. Because of this, he expresses interest in enhancing his diet and exercise, especially exploring guided programs that can fit his busy schedule. He agrees to continue his current plan for managing blood pressure and considers discussing additional measures to address his cholesterol levels, such as modifying his nutritional intake and possibly beginning a more rigorous exercise routine. He will also follow up for further assessments, including more precise evaluations of his overall cardiovascular risk, with the goal of maintaining stable readings and preventing the onset of adverse cardiac events.","Based on the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease, what is the likelihood of 10-year risk of MI or death for this patient?

618,46,Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease,lab test,decimal,2,Synthetic,"A 55-year-old woman presents for evaluation of her cardiovascular health and general wellness. She has never been diagnosed with any cardiac conditions and denies any prior episodes of chest pain, documented heart attacks, or other forms of heart disease. She also reports no known history of diabetes. Her primary motivation for this visit stems from a recent feeling of fatigue and a desire to ensure that she is maintaining healthy habits as she enters her midlife years. She mentions that she has enjoyed relatively good health overall but acknowledges that she has a long-standing habit involving regular tobacco use, citing difficulty in quitting despite multiple considerations in the past. She remains concerned about how this habit may be affecting her overall health, and she expresses an interest in discussing cessation strategies once she completes her initial evaluation. Despite her concerns about potential blood pressure issues, she has never been prescribed medication specifically to address elevated readings in the past. Her blood pressure measurement during this appointment shows a systolic reading of 135, which is slightly higher than previous measurements but not alarmingly so. She notes that her diet has been somewhat variable over the years, often including a moderate amount of vegetables and lean meats, though she concedes that her snack choices sometimes lean heavily toward processed options. She admits that her level of physical activity has diminished somewhat recently because of increased family obligations and longer work hours, making it challenging for her to engage in structured exercise routines. Nonetheless, she occasionally participates in weekend walks or light recreational activities. She remembers receiving a clinical consultation a few years ago noting that her cholesterol levels had been on the higher side of the normal range. At today’s visit, her laboratory results indicate a total cholesterol level of 210, which she finds concerning, given her family history of various cardiovascular problems on her paternal side; her father experienced some cardiac symptoms in his 70s, although specifics are not fully detailed in her recollection. She notes that this familial pattern has prompted her to remain vigilant about her own risk. Additional labs reveal that her high-density lipoprotein level is 55 mg/dL, a value that her healthcare providers indicated was not as worrisome as some other measures, though she is eager to have any abnormal cholesterol trends addressed. She denies any issues with blurred vision, excessive thirst, or frequent urination, and her last fasting glucose assessment at a previous exam was within the normal range, further supporting the absence of diabetes. She states that her energy levels tend to be unpredictable yet not sufficiently problematic to disrupt her routine activities, and she denies any incidents of fainting, shortness of breath, or sensations of heart palpitations. She has never undergone any procedures or interventions for arterial blockages, valve problems, or arrhythmias, and she has never required hospitalization for significant cardiac events. Her body weight, while not severely high, has trended upward in recent years, which she attributes to her increasingly sedentary work. She expresses a desire to discuss both lifestyle modifications and potential steps to better manage her cardiovascular health moving forward. The patient hopes to refocus on improving her dietary regimen, reevaluating her relationship with tobacco, and possibly incorporating a regular exercise program that fits her schedule. Her planned follow-up includes close monitoring of her blood pressure and repeat measurements of cholesterol, as she aspires to maintain or improve these parameters before considering any pharmacological approaches. She is motivated to prevent disease and maintain her quality of life, which she perceives as generally good but threatened by her longstanding habit of tobacco use and the possibility of further elevation in her cholesterol measurements that might place her at risk if not addressed proactively.","Based on the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease, what is the likelihood of 10-year risk of MI or death for this patient?

He described it as sudden in onset, while he was working on his laptop. Location was substernal, radiating to his left arm and jaw. Initially, the pain was 7/10 in intensity but it improved spontaneously even before he reached the hospital or received any medications. On further probing, he reported that he had experienced intermittent episodes of chest pain for the last 3 weeks but it was mostly exertional and was relieved with rest. The pain was not associated with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or nausea/vomiting. He denied any fever, chills, cough, abdominal pain, urinary or bowel complaints. He did not have any family history of significant cardiac events.
On presentation, the patient was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 139/85 mmHg and heart rate of 81 beats per minute. His EKG did not show any ischemic changes, no left ventricular hypertrophy, or left bundle branch block. Three sets of serial troponin enzyme were less than 0.010. Lipid panel showed total cholesterol of 235, triglycerides 408, HDL 26, and LDL could not be calculated. His pretest probability of CAD was intermediate on the basis of age and sex. Since the patient was chest pain free since admission and was able to exercise, an exercise treadmill EKG stress test was ordered. The patient achieved 95% of maximum predicted heart rate and 10 METs of exercise with normalization of slight T wave inversions that were seen in leads V2, V3, and V4 at rest. Thus, it was read as maximum asymptomatic stress test with intermediate probability of ischemia. Echocardiogram was obtained which showed normal left ventricular function and no significant valvular or wall motion abnormalities. At this point, cardiology was consulted to evaluate the patient and they recommended coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) for further risk stratification.
CCTA results showed approximate 70% stenosis of the origin of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) secondary to noncalcified plaque extending over a length of approximately 4 mm (Fig. ), approximate 40–50% stenosis of the proximal ramus intermedius branch secondary to mixed calcified and noncalcified plaque and scattered calcified and noncalcified plaque along the circumflex and obtuse marginal branches with 30–40% luminal diameter stenosis. Fractional flow reserve–computed tomography (FFR-CT) revealed a high likelihood of flow-limiting stenosis with a value of less than 0.5 secondary to the significant stenosis at the origin of the LAD and a low likelihood of flow-limiting stenosis in the left circumflex, ramus intermedius, and right coronary arteries.
The patient was then taken for cardiac catheterization which showed a 95% stenotic lesion of LAD with partial perfusion (TIMI grade 2 flow) giving rise to diagonal 1, which has an ostial and proximal 70% stenosis; ramus intermedius with proximal 70% segmental stenosis; circumflex, nondominant vessel, which has mild disease in proximal distal segments, giving rise to obtuse marginal 1, which has proximal 70% stenosis. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and the patient underwent bypass graft surgery.
The patient did well after the surgery. He stayed in the hospital for 4 days post-op without any complaints and was discharged home in stable condition. A referral to home care was made to provide for monitoring of the patient's progress and detection of any complications during the immediate post-op period. Cardiac rehabilitation referral was also provided and the patient was instructed to follow up with a cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon.","Based on the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease, what is the likelihood of 10-year risk of MI or death for this patient?

602,46,Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease,lab test,decimal,pmc-8279282-1,Extracted,"A 49-year-old male presented to the emergency room with expressive aphasia and right facial droop noticed by his wife. His last known normal neurological status was 1 h prior to arrival to the hospital. He had also been experiencing cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and abdominal pains for about 3 weeks. He had gone to a different emergency room 1 week ago and was diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection and was advised over the counter cough medicine after obtaining a chest X-ray that was normal. His past medical history included possible hypertension for which he was on medication at one point, but currently off medication. He is a non-smoker. His blood pressure was 131/86 mm Hg, heart rate was 120 beats per minute, temperature was 36.4 °C, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and pulse oxygenation was 99% on room air. His neurological examination was consistent with expressive aphasia with right sided facial weakness. His sensation and motor function was intact in all four extremities with no ataxia. His other physical examination was unremarkable. His lab work () including complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were normal except for a creatinine of 1.58 mg/dL (normal: 0.61 - 1.24 mg/dL). His international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.18 (normal: 0.88 - 1.15), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was 27 s (normal: 26 - 39 s), D-dimer was 1,221 ng/mL (normal: < 500 ng/mL). His hemoglobin A1c was 5.8% (normal: < 5.7%), total cholesterol was 191 mg/dL (normal: < 200 mg/dL), triglycerides were 242 mg/dL (normal: 0 - 150 mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was 25 mg/dL (normal: 39 - 79 mg/dL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 107 mg/dL (normal: < 100 mg/dL).
In the emergency room, he received 325 mg of aspirin, and was assessed by a code stroke team. He was not recommended tissue plasminogen activator (tpA) by the tele-neurologist as he had inconsistent symptoms. His chest X-ray was normal, carotid ultrasound showed no stenosis, and computed tomography of the head showed subtle area of diminished attenuation in the right cerebellar hemisphere and left frontoparietal lobe for which a subtle area of infarction could not be excluded. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain completed the following day revealed acute to subacute infarcts in the right cerebellum and left and right frontoparietal cortical regions. He was started on aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily.
He was also tested for COVID-19 and his test result came back with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. He was started on azithromycin, zinc, and vitamin C. He had an echocardiogram of the heart which revealed an ejection fraction of 26-30% (normal: 55-60%) with abnormal left ventricular diastolic function, mildly increased left ventricular wall thickness, mild mitral regurgitation, and moderate global hypokinesis. A cardiologist evaluated him and deemed that he needed to have a transesophageal echocardiogram and left heart catheterization to determine the etiology of the newly diagnosed cardiomyopathy once he is recovered from his acute ischemic event and COVID-19.
On hospital day 4, he was found to have new global aphasia and left upper extremity weakness. He received a stat computed tomography of the brain (), which revealed a new right middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction involving the right frontoparietal lobe and insular cortex. At that point, he was loaded with 600 mg of clopidogrel and transferred to the neuro-intensive care unit. It was decided that since he failed antiplatelet therapy, that the antiplatelet medications aspirin and clopidogrel would be stopped and full-dose anticoagulation was commenced with enoxaparin.
He had hypercoagulability testing done, including antithrombin III, homocysteine, antinuclear antibody, beta-2-glycoprotein, cryoglobulin, and functional protein C, all of which were negative. He did have further testing of lupus anticoagulant which was positive; however, this test was not reliable as he had it done after being started on anticoagulation, which invalidates the reliability of the result.
For his cardiomyopathy, he was placed on a beta-blocker, angiotensin receptor blocker, and a diuretic. He had workup done for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), thyroid function tests, hepatitis serologies, and ferritin levels which were all within normal limits except for slightly elevated ferritin of 523 ng/mL (normal: 24 - 336 ng/mL), which was not high enough to cause cardiomyopathy. He remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the hospital stay. He was advised to have repeat echocardiogram done on an outpatient basis along with ischemic workup including left heart catheterization.
He recovered from the symptoms of COVID-19 including shortness of breath and cough and on the day of discharge, he was saturating 98% on room air and was stable from a pulmonary standpoint.
His hospital course was further complicated by dysphagia requiring a gastric feeding tube, healthcare-associated pneumonia, and staphylococcus bacteremia requiring prolonged antibiotics. He was discharged on the novel oral anticoagulant apixaban and advised repeat hypercoagulability testing in 3 months. He went to a rehabilitation center.","Based on the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease, what is the likelihood of 10-year risk of MI or death for this patient?

He was previously a one-pack-per-day smoker, drank alcohol one to two times per month, but denied drug use. Review of systems was negative for weight loss, headaches, chest pain, shortness of breath, melena, hematemesis, rashes, or joint swelling.
The vital signs were as follows: temperature 37.0°C orally, pulse 103 beats per minute, respiratory rate 11 breaths per minute (bpm), blood pressure 122/67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. Physical examination revealed an alert young man intermittently doubled over in pain with spontaneous resolution. The heart was tachycardic and regular without murmurs, rubs or gallops. The lungs were clear bilaterally with normal work of breathing and no wheezes, rhonchi or rales. His abdomen was soft and non-distended with normoactive bowel sounds, but he demonstrated diffuse tenderness and guarding to palpation. He had no midline or costovertebral angle tenderness, and no ecchymoses were present on inspection of his back. His skin was warm, dry and without any obvious rashes. His neurological examination was grossly intact throughout. The patient was uncircumcised, and his right testicle was lying higher than his left, but neither was tender or swollen. No masses or inguinal hernias were appreciated in the groin.
Laboratory studies were ordered (–), and a point-of-care focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) exam and gallbladder ultrasound were normal. The patient had a formal scrotal ultrasound performed. ().
The patient’s pain was initially well controlled with hydrocodone/acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories; however, as more laboratory and imaging studies resulted, the patient continued to have intermittent pain episodes requiring morphine for analgesia.

She reports two brief coughing episodes this morning during which she noted small streaks of bright red blood mixed with clear sputum; she denies any nosebleed, oral bleeding, or vomiting of blood and states the blood was clearly coughed up rather than coming from the upper airway. The chest discomfort is described as sharp, worse with deep inspiration and with movement of the left shoulder and upper chest, and mildly tender to palpation along the anterior left costochondral margin. She is otherwise in her usual state of health, without recent fevers, chills, rigors, night sweats, or unintended weight loss. She notes mild shortness of breath with exertion today, but has been able to speak in full sentences and perform light activities at home. She denies wheezing, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations. She has not had recent long-distance travel, prolonged immobilization, or recent prolonged bed rest. Three weeks prior, she underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis; she was discharged the same day, has been ambulating independently since, and her incisions have healed without signs of infection or drainage. She is not taking any birth control pills, patches, rings, or menopausal hormone therapy and uses a nonhormonal intrauterine device for contraception. She has no personal history of blood clots in the legs and has never been treated with anticoagulation. There is no known family history of thrombophilia or venous thromboembolism, and she denies active malignancy, recent chemotherapy, or inflammatory bowel disease. She does not smoke and drinks alcohol socially; no recreational drug use. Current medications include only a daily multivitamin and occasional acetaminophen; she denies use of over-the-counter cough suppressants or decongestants prior to arrival. She has no known drug allergies. On arrival, she is alert and in no acute distress, speaking comfortably. Initial vital signs obtained prior to any interventions: temperature 37.1°C, blood pressure 124/76 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, pulse 92 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Body mass index is 24 kg/m². Physical examination reveals clear oropharynx without active bleeding, no gingival bleeding, and no nasal mucosal bleeding; neck is supple without jugular venous distention. Cardiac exam shows a regular rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with good air movement; no wheezes or crackles. There is mild reproducible tenderness over the left anterior third to fourth costochondral junction without crepitus or deformity. Abdomen is soft and nontender with well-healed laparoscopic port sites and no erythema or induration. Peripheral pulses are symmetric. Skin is warm and dry without petechiae or ecchymoses. Neurologic exam is nonfocal with normal mentation and gait. She has not received supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, or analgesics prior to the initial vital signs. Review of systems is otherwise negative for rash, joint swelling, calf cramps, recent upper respiratory infection beyond the cough described, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Given the pleuritic nature of her discomfort and the blood-streaked sputum in the context of recent abdominal surgery within the past month, consideration is given to pulmonary causes including bronchitis with airway irritation, musculoskeletal chest wall pain, and other cardiopulmonary etiologies. She remains hemodynamically stable with normal work of breathing and preserved oxygenation on room air at presentation.",What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)?

641,51,SIRS Criteria,diagnosis,integer,pmc-6935617-1,Extracted,"A 56-year-old woman was referred to our center, with a complaint of abdominal pain and constipation, for a week. From the time of onset, the pain was categorized to be severe, not colic and was localized to the epigastric region only. The patient was alert and ill, while she has had nausea and anorexia, but was not been accompanied by vomiting. Her vital signs were as follows: BP: 85/50, PR: 130, T: 37.2, and RR: 18. Her head, neck, and chest (heart and lung) were normal, and abdomen was fatty and without scarlet and reduced intestinal sounds. She had generalized tenderness with maximum pain intensity in epigastric regions, where her organs were normal. Her medical and corresponding drug history was as follows: antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, DVT, a history of two abortions, and type II diabetes.
Her drug history included: prednisolone tablets, 5 mg: once a day; methotrexate: three pounds a week; hydroxychloroquine tablet: 3 days a week; and warfarin tablets: daily half a pill and insulin.
For further examination, her cardiac activity was monitored, and serum therapy was given to the patient. She was also provided a nasogastric tube, Foley catheter for urinary drainage along with hydrocortisone and antibiotics.
After about 60 minutes, her vitals were as follows: BP: 100/60 and PR: 120.
The result of the preliminary tests showed WBC: 4200, Hb: 7.7, PLT: 80 000, and INR: 4.7 and other tests: normal. Ultrasound from the patient's bedside showed free fluid in the abdomen. Following these tests, the therapeutic intervention was continued as follows: serum, wo packed cell (PC) units, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) units. Meanwhile, the patient was prepared for laparotomy where, during the surgery, her sugar levels kept under control, control, stress-dose cortisol was provided, and she received 5 units of PC and 4 units of FFP.
During the laparotomy, about 3 L of blood and clot were removed from the abdomen. Following this, a cystic lesion was observed in the vicinity of the large stomach flexion that bled due to the invasion of the gastroepyloid vessels (Figure ). After controlling the bleeding, the lesion was fully resected, and samples were examined for pathology (Figure ).
Postoperatively, complete control of the bleeding was achieved with sustained vital signs. However, given the state of preoperative hemorrhagic shock, the patient was kept in ICU until satisfactory recovery was achieved. She also received 5 units of PC and 4 units of FFP, and the vital signs were maintained stable.
Despite there was no recurrence of hemorrhage, she presented pancytopenia perhaps due to the underlying disease (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome). She was hyper-coagulopathic, due to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic shock (cause of referral); therefore, anticoagulant administration was not possible.
After 24 hours and ensuring the stability of vital signs and the absence of Ileus, the patient oral feed was resumed. The postoperative examination for pancytopenia was as follows: WBC: 1500 (PMN: 60%), Hb: 11, PLT: 50 000, INR: 1.7, and K: 3.2. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) therapy was prescribed to the patients after which, her platelets and WBCs showed improvement. The patient's general condition improved, she tolerated the diet, and the bleeding was controlled. Her hemoglobin level did not drop, and therefore, she was transferred to the general ward.
The continuation of treatment was as follows: hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone: half a tablet twice a day, methotrexate was discontinued for 2 weeks, and folic acid and GCSF for 3 days.
Laboratory results showed: platelet <100 000, potassium <3.5, and INR: 1.6. She was administered anticoagulant prophylaxis.
Nine days after the operation, the patient suffered from shortness of breath and tachypnea and a feeling of pressure in the chest. According to the history of the disease, the first diagnosis was a pulmonary embolism, for which anticoagulant therapy was immediately initiated and the patient was transferred to ICU. Her laboratory findings revealed: a decrease in platelets 20 000 and an increase in INR > 3 while ECG was normal. Anticoagulant therapy was restarted.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed a 1.7 cm mass at the head of his pancreas, locally invasive but without the involvement of lymph nodes, superior mesenteric artery, superior mesenteric vein or portal vein. Endoscopic biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. The patient was a poor surgical candidate due to social issues, alcoholism, residence at a nursing home and was at a high-risk for post-surgical complications. The patient was treated palliatively with nine cycles of gemcitabine and paclitaxel. The initial dose of gemcitabine was 2000 mg. The tumor decreased in size and CA 19-9 level declined from an initial level of 2000 to 26 units/mL. Later the dose of gemcitabine was reduced to 1400 mg (20% reduction) after the sixth cycle due to pancytopenia.

649,51,SIRS Criteria,diagnosis,integer,pmc-4499596-1,Extracted,"A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with febrile sensation and cough for 3 days. He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5℃. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.
Chest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.
After three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.
Percutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.
We subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma.

The patient who was discharged on postoperative day four uneventfully presented with complaints of abdominal pain, distended abdomen, nausea, and fever lasting for 24 hours on 4th day after discharge. Her past medical and surgical history was unremarkable except for a previous diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus for which she received prednisolone 16 mg/day as treatment.
On physical examination, she had fever at 38.7 C, blood pressure was 110/60 mm/Hg, heart rate was 100/min, and the respiratory rate was 18/min. She was in mild/acute distress and she was alert and oriented. Abdominal examination was notable for distention, hypoactive bowel sounds, and tenderness in all quadrants. There was guarding and rebound in the lower quadrants of the abdomen.
Laboratory evaluation was remarkable for leukocytosis 18,000/mm3 (4500–10,000/mm3), and highly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of 372 mg/dL (normal range < 5 mg/dL). All other laboratory parameters including electrolytes and renal and liver function tests were within the normal range. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed extravasation of luminal contrast from the anastomosis level into the pelvic region (). In addition, a collection of fluid measuring 8 × 5 cm was noticed in the pelvis. There was associated free air in the peritoneum.
A diagnosis of peritonitis due to anastomosis leakage was made and urgent surgical intervention was recommended. The laparoscopic approach was planned. The abdomen was entered laparoscopically via the previous trocar sites. On laparoscopic exploration, the anastomosis site was characterized with small bowel adhesions covered with layers of fibrin clots and purulent fluid accumulation in the pelvic region. Aspiration of the purulent fluid was performed followed by separation of the small bowel adhesions. A 1 cm colon peritoneal fistula covered with fibrin layers was identified at the anastomosis site, which localized intraperitoneally. There was no fecal contamination. The abdomen was irrigated with isotonic saline solution and a complete decontamination of the pelvic contents was performed. After adequate drainage of pelvic collection, a drain was placed through the port site at the left lower quadrant across the anastomosis site into the pelvic region and the procedure was ended. The need for an ostomy was precluded as an endoscopic stent was planned for the closure of the anastomosis site. However, because our endoscopy unit had not been work at night time as emergency services, the patient was sent to the endoscopy unit on 5th hour after the operation.
At sigmoidoscopy, the anastomosis site with 1 cm fistula was identified at 17 cm above the anal verge (). To close the fistula, a 12 cm long partially coated SEMS (Hanarostent Duodenum/Pylorus Lasso, NCN, MI Tech Co., Seoul, South Korea) was placed across the site of leak successfully (). The patient was placed on prophylactic treatment with a third generation cephalosporin and intravenous metronidazole. A dramatic decrease in the patients fever and leukocytosis was observed 24 hours after the procedure. Abdominal pain gradually resolved and oral feeding was started. Abdominal drainage which started at a rate of 150–200 cc/day ceased after 5 days. Follow-up CT demonstrated complete resolution of the anastomosis leak and abscess. The drain was removed and stent removal was planned at four weeks after the procedures. On the seventh postoperative day, the patient was discharged uneventfully. Twenty-four days after the procedure, the patient presented again. She reported an incident of the stent falling out and passing in bowel motion. Sigmoidoscopy was performed and it was consistent with a complete healing of the anastomosis site, while the absence of the stent in the previously inserted location was confirmed ().

Her initial laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/µL (normal range [NR] 3.8-10.8 K/µL), absolute lymphocyte count of 0.64 K/µL (NR 0.85-3.9 K/µL), hemoglobin 14.1 g/dL (NR 13.2-17.1 g/dL), platelets 214 K/µL (NR 140-400 K/µL), C-reactive protein 30.94 mg/dL (NR < 0.80 mg/dL), ferritin 998 µg/L, lactic acid 3.3 mmol/L (NR 0.5-2.2 mmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase 556 U/L (NR 125-220 U/L), troponin was negative (NR < 0.30 ng/mL), creatinine 1.0 mg/dL (NR 0.7-1.3 mg/dL), Na 138 mmol/L (NR 135-145 mmol/L), K 3.4 mmol/L (NR 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), and high-sensitivity D-dimer 806 ng/mL (NR < 231 ng/mL).
The chest radiograph obtained in the emergency department demonstrated multiple rounded and peripheral ground-glass opacities throughout the lung fields (Figure ).
A nasopharyngeal swab was performed and tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. Due to severe hypoxia, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). On hospital day 2, she underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation for worsening tachypnea and respiratory distress. The patient was started on intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone 40 mg every eight hours), received a dose of tocilizumab 400 mg, and completed a five-day course of hydroxychloroquine (800 mg/day for one day, then 400 mg/day for four days) and azithromycin (500 mg/day for one day, then 250 mg/day for four days).
On hospital day 3, her renal function worsened, and her creatinine peaked at 2.4 mg/dL, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis. However, she remained with good urine output and no significant metabolic acidosis. Her creatinine gradually improved on the subsequent days, returning to the baseline renal function. The patient remained stable hemodynamically and sedated with hydromorphone and ketamine, but despite the optimized medical management she continued to spike fevers at 102°F, and repeated chest imaging with CT on day 5 showed significant worsening bilateral ground-glass airspace opacities (Figure ).
On hospital day 7, she received convalescent plasma transfusion and started on vancomycin after respiratory cultures demonstrated the presence of Staphylococcus aureus infection. On hospital day 8, the patient had an episode of oxygen desaturation to 75% with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 79, despite being on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 100% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 12 cm H2O. She was bagged by the respiratory therapist for over one hour and given the failure of mechanical ventilation to provide adequate oxygenation, the decision was to start VV-ECMO.
The patient’s left femoral vein was cannulated with a 28-Fr heparin-coated cannula for blood return and the left internal jugular vein was cannulated with a 21-Fr cannula for blood access. The patient was placed on VV-ECMO (CentriMag [Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA] short-term external circulatory device) with initial settings of flow 4.5 liters per minute, speed 3,300 revolutions per minute, and ECMO FiO2 100%, sweep three liters per minute. She was started on heparin drip, received infusion of neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium for a short period, and then remained sedated with hydromorphone and lorazepam. She continued to have episodes of fevers up to 101°F, and repeated sputum cultures demonstrated the presence of Acinetobacter species and Proteus mirabilis, while blood cultures were negative. She was placed on cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia and the episodes of fevers gradually improved.
On the following two weeks, the patient was gradually able to wean down VV-ECMO settings, decreasing ECMO FiO2 to 40%, and flow to 3.6 liters per minute. On hospital day 20, she had a transvenous pacemaker placed due to several episodes of bradycardia with pauses lasting up to 19 seconds during oral care, likely vagally mediated. On hospital day 21, a bronchoscopy was performed and showed minimal secretions and no mucus plug. Given her prolonged time intubated, she underwent tracheostomy placement on hospital day 22. On hospital day 26, the patient was finally able to have VV-ECMO explanted, after 18 days of extracorporeal therapy. As she continued to improve clinically, the mechanical ventilation was successfully weaned off on hospital day 38. The patient was noted to have no neurological deficits, and was able to be downgraded from ICU to the medical ward on the following day.",What are the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.,"{'Temperature': [99.0, 'degrees fahrenheit'], 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [106.0, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [34.0, 'breaths per minute'], 'White blood cell count': [10900.0, 'µL']}",2,2,2,"The rules for SIRS Criteria are listed below:
    
1. Temperature >38°C (100.4°F) or <36°C (96.8°F): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point
2. Heart rate >90: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point
3. Respiratory rate >20 or PaCO₂ <32 mm Hg: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point
4. White blood cell count (WBC) >12,000/mm³, <4,000/mm³, or >10% bands: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point

The total number of criteria met is taken by summing the score for each criteria.
    
The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.
The patient's temperature is 99.0 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 67.0 = 37.22222 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 106.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 10900.0 count/µL. To convert 10900.0 count/µL of white blood cell to mm^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1.0 µL/mm^3 which will give 10900.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1.0 µL/mm^3 = 10900.0 white blood cell count/mm^3. Because the white blood cell count is between 4000 and 12000 count per mm^3, this does not meet SIRS criteria for white blood cell count, and so the current total remains at 1.
The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 34.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg. At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 1 + 1 = 2 criteria met.
Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 2."

751,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-4208265-1,Extracted,"A 16-year-old Korean male presented with two episodes of lower leg paralysis in the morning for two weeks. The first episode was a sudden onset of complete paralysis below distal thigh, and he had no other symptoms except leg paralysis. At a local clinic, physical examination revealed symmetric hyporeflexia in both lower extremities. Laboratory analysis revealed mild hypokalemia as below: Na+, 146 mmol/L; K+, 2.7 mmol/L; Cl-, 110 mmol/L; tCO2, 25 mmol/L without abnormality of blood gas analysis. Electrocardiogram showed only sinus tachycardia without atrioventricular block or prominent U wave. However, further evaluation for hypokalemia was not taken, even though there was a suggestion of hypokalemic paralysis, and the patient was just advised to eat an adequate dietary supplement of potassium rich food without any medication by the local clinic. After two weeks, a second episode of leg weakness occurred after morning meal. The muscle weakness was initially subtle but progressed in paralysis below knee and lasted for 6 hours. Thus, he was referred to our hospital. However, the patient visited our clinic the next day, when the paralysis had already subsided.
There was no past history or family history of neuromuscular disease and endocrinologic disease, except for his aunt's hypothyroidism. His appearance was reasonably healthy. His height was 168 cm, his weight was 60 kg, and his body mass index was 21.2 kg/m2. His blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg, his respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and his body temperature was 36.8℃. He had mild tachycardia with a heart rate of 100-110 beats/min,, but he had no palpitations. Neurological examination findings, including deep tendon reflex and cerebellar function test, were normal. The laboratory findings showed normal complete blood cell counts, normal electrolytes as below: Na+, 140 mmol/L; K+, 4.4 mmol/L; Cl-, 104 mmol/L; tCO2, 24 mmol/L. The laboratory findings also showed his normal liver, kidney and cardiac functions. His urine K+ excretion rate was normally low as 0.96 of urine K+/Cr ratio (range, 0-2). There were no abnormal laboratory findings to suggest adrenal hormone excess or primary hyperaldosteronism: adrenocorticotropic hormone, 40.11 pg/mL (range, 3.5-13.2 pg/mL); cortisol, 8.7 µg/dL (range, 5.0-23.0 µg/dL); 17 hydroxyprogesterone, 2.68 ng/mL (range, 0.6-3.42 ng/mL); aldosterone, 180.29 pg/mL (range, 38.9-306.8 pg/mL); renin, 6.13 ng/mL/hr (range, 1.31-3.95 ng/mL/hr); epinephrine, 0.030 ng/mL (range, 0-0.30 ng/mL); norepinephrine, 0.087 ng/mL (range, 0-0.80 ng/mL). Thyroid function test (TFT) revealed a hyperthyroidism: serum free thyroxine (fT4), 2.10 ng/dL (range, 0.70-1.48 ng/dL); triiodothyronine (T3), 2.95 ng/mL (range, 0.58-1.59 ng/mL); thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), <0.025 mU/L (range, 0.35-4.94 mU/L). Thus, he was diagnosed as having hypokalemic paralysis due to hyperthyroidim. Serum TSH receptor antibodies were high at 6.05 IU/L (range, 0-1.75 IU/L), thyroid stimulating antibody was positive, and thyroid ultrasonography revealed diffuse enlarged thyroid and increased vascularity. These findings were consistent with Graves' disease as etiology of his hyperthyroidism. He was initially treated with lower dose of an antithyroid drug (methimazole 5 mg once daily) than usual, since his thyrotoxic symptoms and signs were absent, and his level of serum fT4 was not prominent. In addition, a β-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) was simultaneously used for preventing the paralysis. After two weeks, a follow-up TFT revealed aggravated hyperthyroidism, and he was treated with increased dose of antithyroid drugs. After two months, since his heart rate and blood pressure were stable and he had no symptoms of palpitations, β-blockers were discontinued successfully. No paralysis has occurred for one year, as hyperthyroidism can be well controlled with antithyroid drugs ().",What is the patient's body surface area? Please output your answer in terms of m².

He also complained of numbness and a tingling sensation on the left lateral side of the lower leg and dorsum of the foot. At the time of referral, the left leg and foot were soft and non-tender. Only the right dorsalis pedis was pulsatile, but not on the left side. Pain in the left lateral lower leg and dorsum of foot was scored 3/10 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. The Medical Research Council scale for weakness showed the following grades (right/left): hip extension 5/5, knee flexion 5/5, ankle dorsiflexion 5/1, and hallucis extension 5/1. He had no lower back pain and the straight leg raise reached 80° on both sides. A positive Tinel's sign behind the fibular neck on the left side was noted. In a nerve conduction study, there was no compound motor action potential in the left deep peroneal nerve on the left extensor digitorum brevis or tibialis anterior muscle recordings, and no evoked sensory nerve action potential in the left superficial peroneal nerve (). Needle electromyography showed abnormal spontaneous activity at rest and no motor unit action potential activity in the left tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and peroneus brevis muscles (). Computed tomography (CT) angiogram showed proximal occlusion of the left anterior tibial artery (ATA) () without any abnormal findings of the soft tissue. This led to a diagnosis of left common peroneal neuropathy due to occlusion of the left ATA. The patient was treated with oral warfarin.
The patient's medical history was reviewed. He did not have diabetes mellitus. He received a mitral valve replacement 5 years ago due to mitral stenosis, and echocardiography showed a moderate degree of aortic stenosis and regurgitation. In addition, he had complete atrioventricular block and valvular atrial fibrillation; and had a pacemaker inserted three years prior to referral. However, he had been prescribed only an antiplatelet agent because of a history of cerebellar intracranial hemorrhage 2 years previously.
Approximately 4 weeks prior to referral, he visited another hospital suffering from chest pain, and received percutaneous coronary angiography which took about 30 minutes. After percutaneous coronary angiography, he received conservative care in a general ward, without any physical restrain or requirement for absolute bed rest. He could ambulate the ward with only minimal assistance. Some days later, he complained of left leg weakness and a brain CT was performed to rule out an acute brain lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was contraindicated because of the cardiac pacemaker. The brain CT showed a subacute ischemic lesion in the right posterior temporal region but it did not clinically correlate with the weakness. Although he complained of foot drop and paresthesia, there were no symptoms of anterior compartment syndrome such as tenderness, redness or swelling of low leg. No deep vein thrombosis or abnormal findings of soft tissues were found upon ultrasonography of the left leg. After improvement of the chest pain, he was discharged home. Two weeks later he was admitted to the cardiology department in the present hospital due to chest pain, and was referred to the rehabilitation department. After diagnosis of the left common peroneal neuropathy and improvement of the chest discomfort with conservative therapy, he was transferred and received rehabilitation.",What is the patient's body surface area?

During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 µmol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively. The patient could walk with slight pain at this time with a VAS score of 1 and was very satisfied with the outcome. Regular monitoring of serum uric acid concentrations and his modified diet continued, and he has been followed up for 12 months.",What is the patient's body surface area?

She had a chest X-ray before a gastrofibroscopy at a local hospital. There were multiple rib fractures (). For further evaluation, she had a chest computed tomography (CT) scan done before visiting our hospital. The chest CT revealed multiple sclerotic masses with bone destruction in both hemithoraxes (right 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 10th ribs, left 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th, and 9th ribs) of variable size (). Initially she was admitted to the pulmonology department to rule out bony metastases from a cancer of unknown origin. She had taken the bone densitometry of the L1-L4 lumbar spine by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), at the local department of gynecology 1.5 years ago. The result of bone mineral density (BMD) was 0.726 g/cm2 and the average T-score of the L1-L4 lumbar spine was -2.6. The average Z-score of the L1-L4 lumbar spine was -2.0. Therefore, she was taking calcium, vitamin D supplements and hormone replacement therapy for osteoporosis. She also had a conization in 2002 due to squamous cell carcinoma in situ at the uterine cervix and thereafter received a total hysterectomy in 2005 due to uterine leiomyoma. She had no alcohol drinking or smoking history. There were no abnormal findings in her family history. Also, she had no trauma history. She did not have moon face, buffalo hump, or abdominal straie. She didn't have any pain on her ribs. On the physical examination, there wasn't tenderness around fracture sites. Her height and weight were 153 cm and 53 kg, respectively, with a body mass index (BMI) of 22 kg/m2. Her waist measurement was 83 cm, and she had experienced no recent weight changes. Her blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg with a pulse of 96 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and a body temperature of 36.8℃. On the blood test, the leukocyte, hemoglobin, and platelet counts were 8,900/mm3 (neutrophils 85.9%, lymphocyte 8.4%, monocyte 5.7%), 14.9 g/dL, and 184,000/µL, respectively. Fasting glucose, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine were 93 mg/dL, 4.0 g/dL, 45 IU/L, 81 IU/L, 49 IU/L, and 0.56 mg/dL, respectively. Total calcium and phosphate were 10.5 mg/dL and 3.5 mg/dL, respectively. In addition, serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was 35.6 pg/mL (normal range, 13-54 pg/mL).
To evaluate the patient for metastatic cancer, a bone biopsy was performed at the right 6th rib posterior arc in the pulmonology department. Also a bone scan and the bone densitometry of the L1-L4 lumbar spine and an abdominal CT were performed. Fragmented bony particles with small amounts of marrow tissue were observed in the biopsy tissue.
There were no cancer cells nor cytokeratin (CK)-positive epithelial cells on immunohistochemical staining. There was no cancerous lesion in abdomen CT, except a left adrenal incidentaloma, a well-marginated soft tissue mass 25 mm in diameter, was found (). On the bone scan, multi-focal increased uptake was observed in both ribs, suggesting non-traumatic micro-fractures caused by osteoporosis (). The average BMD, T-score and Z-score of the L1-L4 lumbar spine was 0.761 g/cm2, -2.1 and -1.7, respectively. Therefore, an endocrine cause of osteoporotic fracture was suspected, and a hormonal study for adrenal incidentaloma was performed. Free cortisol in the urine and 17-hydroxycorticosteroid were 580.4 µg/day (normal range, 20-90 µg/day) and 12.93 mg/day (normal range, 3-15 mg/day), respectively. A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test showed that the serum adrenocorticotrophic hormone level was 1.4 pg/mL (normal <130 pg/mL), the basal cortisol was 26.3 µg/dL and the cortisol on the 3rd day was 35.4 µg/dL (normal, 3-6 µg/dL). Cortisol was not suppressed. Finally, she was diagnosed with Cushing's syndrome due to the left adrenocortical adenoma. A laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was performed in June 2009. A month after the laparoscopic left adrenalectomy, 24-hr urine free cortisol was checked, and was below 1.8 µg/day. A bone scan taken 1 year after the operation showed decreased multifocal uptake in the bilateral ribs () and the patient's BMD improved gradually, reaching 0.822 g/cm2 in 2012 (). Also, the average T-score and Z-score of the L1-L4 lumbar spine improved, reaching -1.6 and -1.0, respectively.

764,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-7049766-1,Extracted,"A 31-year-old female patient was referred by her orthodontist to Asan Medical Center in Seoul, Korea for treatment of facial asymmetry and prognathism. The patient had never been diagnosed with a medical problem and had no previous history of fracture. Clinical examination revealed that the patient was slightly short in height (153.4 cm) and moderately overweight (62.4 kg, body mass index [BMI] 26.52 kg/m2). Examination of her facial features revealed a long lower face with vertical maxillary excess and mandibular asymmetry with occlusal canting of the maxilla. In addition, she had upper lip protrusion and lip incompetence.(, ) The intraoral findings included Class III malocclusion with an open bite. She had normal tooth structure and received proper dental care. Therefore, her periodontal health and oral hygiene were good.
After the initial interview, the patient was referred to an orthodontist for leveling and alignment of the teeth, and treatment continued for approximately one year. After the presurgical orthodontic treatment, a clinical evaluation was repeated, and cephalometric radiographs and face bow recordings were obtained for final surgical planning 4 weeks prior to the surgery.
In addition, a work-up for general anesthesia and surgery was performed, and the preoperative hematologic examination, electrocardiogram and chest radiograph were unremarkable.
The surgery included bimaxillary procedures. Le Fort I osteotomy with midline correction, canting correction, posterior impaction, and setback movement of the maxilla were performed via rigid skeletal fixation. Bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomies were performed with a setback movement via the hybrid fixation technique (with one miniplate and one additional bicortical screw). On the left side, a greenstick fracture occurred in the proximal segment. However, we could appropriately position the proximal and distal segments as planned, and so two additional bicortical screws were used to fix the fractured proximal segment. Two closed suction drains were inserted into the mandibular surgical site. The operation was completed without major bleeding, and the estimated blood loss during the surgery was 200 mL.
Abnormal edema and ecchymosis were observed from the second postoperative day.() At first, an improperly functioning closed suction drain was suspected, but the ecchymosis and edema appeared to be bilateral, decreasing the likelihood of drain malfunction. On the second postoperative day, drain removal and maxilla-mandibular fixation (MMF) with elastic ring were routinely performed. Normally, an orthognathic surgical patient is hospitalized for 2 nights and 3 days after surgery, but in this case, the discharge was delayed due to the appearance of abnormal ecchymosis and edema. On the fifth postoperative day, nasal bleeding and transient blood pressure lowering were noted, but the problems resolved after nasal packing and administration of intravenous fluids. At 6 days postoperatively, the patient was stable, and she was discharged from the hospital.
MMF was routinely stopped 2 weeks after surgery, and training elastics were applied. No other complications were observed. However, the ecchymosis persisted for 6 weeks, and although it dissipated slowly and spontaneously, no specific treatment was needed for its resolution. The follow-up examination at postoperative 3 months showed uneventful healing.
During the search for the cause of unexpected postoperative bleeding, she recounted multiple fractures of the lower limbs during childhood, and blue sclera was noticed. Furthermore, her familial history included multiple bone fractures in her mother, grandmother, and cousin. Therefore, OI type I was suspected, and it was inferred that the patient's complications were ultimately caused by bleeding due to vessel fragility from OI.
The postsurgical orthodontic treatment began one month after surgery. The molar and canine relation became Class I, and the open bite was greatly improved.

He was born full-term via normal vaginal delivery to a 35-year-old G3P3 mother, with no perinatal complications. However, there was intake of an abortifacient (4 tablets of misoprostol) on the 5th week of pregnancy. At birth, there was noted “monggo seed” sized penis and “paper-thin” scrotum. His mother was advised by the local health center physician to seek consult with a surgeon however due to financial difficulties, there were no tests nor consult with a specialist done. His childhood and pre-puberty years were unremarkable. There were no symptoms of palpitations, heat or cold intolerance, polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia. There were no episodes of frequent urinary tract infection, dysuria, or abdominal pain. There were no instances of elevated blood pressure, headache, change in vision. There were no significant health problems during his childhood except for appendicitis for which he underwent an emergency appendectomy in July 28, 2008 at Ospital ng Makati.
However, at around 14 to 16 years of age, there was persistence of high pitched voice, scant pubic and axillary hair and fat deposition on waist and bilateral breasts. There was minimal growth in penile size at approximately 2-3 centimeters (cm) and a bilateral palpable scrotal sac.
On physical examination, he was ambulatory with stable vital signs. He is overweight with BMI of 29.09 kg/m2 and weight of 74.5 kilograms. His waist to hip ratio is 0.89 with his waist circumference spanning 86 cm and hip circumference at 96.5 cm. He presented with eunuchoid proportion () with a height of 162 cm and arm span of 171 cms. His mother stands 151 cm while his father at 169 cm with computed mid parental height for boys of 166.5 cm. Thyroid gland was not palpable. He has gynecomastia without galactorrhea (). Genital and pubic hair development was graded as Tanner Stage 1 (). He has a flaccid and stretched penile lengths of 2.5 and 3 cm respectively with width of 4 cm. He has palpable small, firm left testis while non palpable on the right. Neurologic examination was normal except for bilateral anosmia. Evaluation was done by Otorhinolaryngology service which showed recurrent rhinosinusitis. CT scan of paranasal sinuses showed pansinusitis with opacified and widened ostiomeatal units. A trial of steroid therapy was recommended which provided slight relief of anosmia.
Micropenis is defined by Schonfeld and Beebe as Stretched Penile Length (SPL) 2.5 SD less than the mean for age without the presence of any other penile anomalies and presence of internal and external genital organs compatible with a 46 XY karyotype. For an average adult patient, mean stretched penile length is 13.3 cm with 9.3 cm as the calculated 2.5 standard deviation less than the mean for age. The patient has a stretched penile length of 3 cm falling more than 2.5 SD below the mean for adult.
To satisfy the criteria for micropenis, pelvic and inguino-scrotal ultrasound was done to confirm the presence of internal genital organs, which revealed small left testicle measuring 0.9x0.5x0.7 cm with chronic parenchymal changes and a non visualized right testicle. The prostate gland measures 2.2x1.6x1.7 cm (∼3 grams). A whole abdominal CT scan was done with noted left inguinal hernia and ovoid soft tissue density in right inguinal region possibly representing the right testis. Other findings include hepatic steatosis and nephrocalcinosis on the left. Lastly, to satisfy the criteria, chromosome analysis was done revealing a karyotype with no numerical and structural aberrations and an XY sex chromosome complement in all 50 cells examined. Hence the patient has a male karyotype of 46,XY.
However, the patient did not just present with isolated micropenis. Alongside, he has gynecomastia, persistently high pitched voice and underdeveloped adult sexual characteristics. Most authorities accept the definition of delayed puberty as the absence of secondary sexual development at an age 2 SD above the mean age of onset of puberty. This is the age at which 95% of normal children have already entered puberty. Based on etiology, pubertal delay can be classified into constitutional growth delay or hypogonadism. The latter can be further classified into hypogonadotropic or hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.
Though stature is the most obvious change in growth, the ratio of the upper and lower segment also changes significantly. Sex steroids are necessary for increase in growth hormone secretion and they directly stimulate epiphyseal plate’s growth and fusion. In prepubertal hypogonadism, where the growth plates are not yet fused and there is lack of sex steroids, growth plates of the extremities continue to grow past the usual age of cessation. As a result, there is decreased upper to lower ratio and an increased arm span for height leading to eunuchoid proportion like in the patient.
Aside from this, determination of skeletal development by x-ray of left hand and wrist is also a useful way of establishing the stage of physiological development which in some cases may not be parallel with chronological age. The patient has a delayed bone age (compatible to 16 and 5/12 to 14 and 5/12 year old male) by the Greulich-Pyle method (). Estradiol is a product of aromatization of testosterone and it mediates additional effects of testosterone on bone resorption, epiphyseal closure, sexual desire, and fat deposition. From the physical examination and the patient’s bone x-ray, this low estradiol might have contributed to the unfused ossification centers and eunuchoid proportion. Related to this is that androstenedione is converted to testosterone by 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase before it gets aromatized to estradiol. However, androstenedione itself can be aromatized to estrogen which might have contributed to gynecomastia and fat deposition.
The patient’s cranial MRI showed a shallow sella with apparent flattening of pituitary gland at its floor (). The results of baseline endocrine tests are summarized in showing hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (low testosterone, FSH and LH). Other biochemical results are summarized in which showed normal fasting blood sugar, serum sodium, potassium, AST and ALT. While, lipid profile showed normal levels of total cholesterol and triglyceride but elevated LDL.
With these findings, the patient was diagnosed with Primary Empty Sella (PES) (Partial) which is probably congenital based on history of abortifacient use on first trimester of pregnancy, findings of prepubertal hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and MRI showing a partially empty sella.
He was referred to Endocrinology and Urology services. Sex hormone replacement was recommended. He was offered testosterone therapy however this was not yet started due to lack of funds. Steroid was not initiated since serum cortisol is just borderline low and patient is also asymptomatic. Orchiectomy as prophylaxis for development of malignancy is not warranted but orchidopexy may be offered to monitor tumor development.
Counseling was offered regarding possible psychosocial impact of the physical changes brought about by the endocrine problem. Since he has a partner it was also suggested in order to help them regarding possible plans to have children. However, they refused the offer since they’ve already decided to adopt a child in the future. The patient verbalized that currently, the psychical changes has no derogatory impact on his personal and social life.
For continuation of care and surveillance of the possible impact of the hormonal deficiencies on other organ systems, the patient was endorsed to the succeeding endocrinology rotator and outpatient resident. He was last seen on December 2019 and repeat blood chemistries were requested; however, he was lost to follow up thereafter.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?

She had been diagnosed with TA 7 years prior to this presentation. However she refused medications and further evaluation until delivery. Computed tomographic angiography performed 3 years prior had revealed that the left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery were totally occluded along with a thrombotic aneurysm 5.8 × 5.2 × 9.6 cm in size (). She also had a localized dissection in the low abdominal aorta and focal stenosis in the descending aorta as well as a large left coronary aneurysm and about 50% stenosis of the right coronary artery. Plain chest radiographs revealed a huge superior mediastinal mass which was suspected of an aneurysm with thrombus in the left subclavian artery (). Cardiac single photon emission computed tomography and echocardiography were performed preoperatively to follow up on her coronary artery statuses. These examinations showed an old myocardial infarct, a persistent perfusion defect in the basal inferior wall and a reduction in wall motion.
The patient had been diagnosed with Type III TA as determined by the involvement of the aortic arch and coronary artery as well as the descending thoracic and abdominal aortas. She developed dyspnea on exertion with New York Heart Association Functional Class III. On physical examination, peripheral pulsations were weak in all limbs except the right arm. Heart rate was 120 beats/min, and non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) was 96/78 mmHg in the right upper limb and 95/69 mmHg in the left upper limb. NIBP in the lower limbs measured 148/99 mmHg on the right and 156/95 mmHg on the left. She was cooperative and neurological examinations indicated normal results. A slowly titrated epidural anesthesia was selected to maintain hemodynamic stability. Regional anesthesia functioned as a simple and reliable monitor of cerebral perfusion through the patient's level of consciousness. For these reasons, we planned and executed an elective caesarean section under epidural anesthesia.
On arrival at the operating room, we began intraoperative monitoring by electrocardiography, pulse oximetry and NIBP measurement. Electrocardiography was unremarkable with a heart rate of 126 beats/min and the pulse oximeter on her right index finger displayed a normal waveform with a saturation of 95-96% in room air. She was alert and oriented, and her initial NIBP was 113/77 mmHg in the right upper limb. Her left radial, brachial and axillary arteries pulsed feebly, whereas her brachial and axillary arterial pulsations were stronger on the right than on the left. An artery cannula was placed in the right radial artery under local anesthesia connected to a FloTrac™ sensor and Vigileo™ monitor system (Edward Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) device for continuous cardiac output assessments to monitor continuous blood flow. The initial cardiac index was 1.5 L/min/m2. A cerebral oximeter probe (Invos™, Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter 5100C, Somanetics Corporation, Troy, MI, USA) was attached to the forehead. The initial regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) levels were 64% on the right and 51% on the left.
After placing the patient in the left lateral recumbent position, the median approach was performed with loss of resistance technique using an 18 G Tuohy needle between the L4 and L5 lumbar spines. The catheter was inserted and fixed. Her position was then changed to the supine position with a wedge under her right hip. The height of the block was increased gradually to T5 by using 11 ml of 2% lidocaine injected through an epidural catheter. Oxygen was administered via a VentiR mask, and a capnometer was installed below her nose to monitor respiration. The value of rSO2 was stable. Ten minutes after skin incision, a 3,180 gram girl was delivered and her Apgar score was 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.
Three minutes after delivery, the placenta was removed and 20 IU of oxytocin diluted in 1,000 ml of 0.9% saline continued to be intravenously infused. The rSO2 levels dropped from 64 to 61% on the right and from 51 to 39% in the left at 6 minutes after delivery. At that time, we were able to obtain NIBP measurements. Arterial blood pressure was 56/48 mmHg without changes in cardiac index. She complained of dysarthria, tinnitus, and stiffness of the posterior neck (). An intravenous infusion of phenylephrine (100 mcg) and rapid administration of colloid (300 ml over 10 minutes) improved dysarthria, tinnitus and stiffness of the posterior neck as rSO2 increased from 61 to 78% on the right and from 39 to 56% on the left. There was no corresponding change in arterial blood pressure and cardiac index with the increase of the NIBP to 81/71 mmHg. However, she still complained of numbness of the face and blurred vision. Her laboratorial test results were as follows: hemoglobin, 9.0 mg/dl; hematocrit, 26%; Na+, 135 mg/dl; K+, 3.03 mg/dl; and Ca2+, 0.85 mmol/L.
The patient's facial numbness and blurred vision were resolved 20 minutes after the neurologic symptoms developed. Over time, her arterial compliance was reduced and invasive arterial blood pressure waveform damped along with a progressive decline in pulse pressure (). She lost about 1,000 ml of blood and received, in total, 500 ml of colloid solution, 2,500 ml of crystalloid, and 1 unit of blood were infused.
The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for special attention to neurologic symptoms with continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring. Even though no focal neurologic deficits, postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging and a magnetic resonance angiographic study were performed to rule out acute cerebral infarction. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple old infarcts in the right frontal and left frontotemporoparietal areas and a suspicious acute left cerebellar small infarct. In addition, there were complete occlusions of the left subclavian, left common carotid, internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries. There were near-complete occlusions of the bilateral proximal vertebral arteries. The left distal vertebral artery was reconstituted by the left thyrocervical trunk (). She refused further treatments, including surgery. She was discharged on the sixth postoperative day.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?

The patient had two puncture biopsies of the right breast mass within 2 years, both of which revealed intraductal papilloma. But the lump progressed quickly, covering almost her entire right breast and invading the nipple, and the skin was broken and infected (). Therefore, the patient strongly expressed her desire of having breast surgery. Nevertheless, electrocardiogram revealed atrial ectopic rhythm and atrial fibrillation, and echocardiogram demonstrated enlargement of heart, left ventricular myohypertrophia, aortic valve sclerosis, and severe stenosis. The maximum cross valve pressure difference in aortic valve was 114 mmHg and average pressure difference was 72 mmHg, and moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (). Coronary angiography was performed, and no abnormality was detected. Considering the patient’s severe heart disease and biopsy results in another hospital, she was scheduled for a lump-resection and rapid pathological examination by biopsy.
However, the patient was considered as having high risk for GA. For avoiding GA, a regional anesthesia plan using the ultrasound-guided regional block was proposed to the patient, and anesthesiologic written informed consent was acquired.
On admission to the operating room, standard monitoring was established, and her vitals were recorded as follows: non-invasive blood pressure 155/95 mmHg, heart rate 75 bpm, and SpO2 94%. Then, a patent airway was maintained with oxygen supplementation through the mask at 5 L/min. Vasoactive agents for potential perioperative cardiovascular events, such as esmolol, nicardipine, and norepinephrine, were prepared. Approximately 30 µg dexmedetomidine and 5 µg sufentanil were added into the Murphy’s dropper and dropped slowly. Following this, a skin wheal was raised using 2 ml of 1% lidocaine, and the patient’s radial artery was punctured to measure the invasive arterial pressure.
After sterile technique, the right side thoracic paravertebral nerve block (TPVB) was performed under ultrasound guidance with Philips CX30 Diagnostic Ultrasound System and a high-frequency linear transducer with an in-plane approach. The probe was placed in T4–5 intervertebral space and rotated to locate into the T4–5 paraspinal space. A 22G 80-mm short beveled Stimuplex needle was advanced in plane with the transducer and through the transverse costal ligament. After gentle negative blood aspiration, 30 ml of 0. 375% ropivacaine was injected. In addition, right subclavicular brachial plexus block was performed with 7 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine for blocking the long thoracic nerve. Finally, the ultrasound probe was placed in the outer third of the right subclavian, marked by the thoracic wall branch of the thoracic acromial artery between the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor, and 13 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine was injected to execute the right-side pectoralis plane block (PECS) 1.
No complications were observed. The operation was initiated when the cold sensation was lost, approximately 30 min after the execution of the blocks. The patient tolerated the procedure well and showed no significant hemodynamic changes (blood pressure [BP]: 140/75 mmHg, heart rate [HR]: 60 bpm, SpO2: 99%).
However, the surgeon quickly decided to perform modified radical mastectomy upon considering the pathological results (enveloping papillary carcinoma). On wiping the axillary lymph nodes, discharge was observed from the patient’s upper limbs. We decided to insert the laryngeal mask airway combined with sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia, and sedation was achieved with 0.6 MAC sevoflurane without using opioids. During this period, the patient had stable vital signs with BP: 110/70 mmHg, HR: 55 bpm, and SpO2: 99%. In addition, the patient breathed spontaneously for the perioperative period. Approximately half an hour later, the axillary nodes were dissected, and laryngeal mask was pulled out for narrowing the duration of GA. The operation was successfully completed. The operation time was 2.5 h, and the intraoperative blood loss was 50 ml and urine volume was 300 ml. The patient received 1,300 ml of Ringer’s solution during surgery. And the patient was revived with steady hemodynamics. We maintained communication with the patient from the regional block process to inhalation-anesthesia, and the patient cooperated without any complaint of discomfort. Postoperatively, the patient confirmed that she was satisfied with the anesthesia process. The postoperative pathological findings revealed an enveloping papillary carcinoma with infiltrating papillary carcinoma and (9/12) lymph node metastases (). The patient was shifted to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit following the procedure, then shifted back to the general ward after 2 days and was discharged after 11 days. A 3-month follow-up revealed that the patient was in fair condition. Chemotherapy had been initiated, and cardiac surgery was planned.

He also had long-standing diabetes, hypertension and was on multiple medications such as regular insulin, aspirin 75 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, metoprolol 25 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg daily and nitrocontin 2.6 mg twice daily.
On examination, he was obese with poor effort tolerance. There was no pallor or edema feet and no signs of heart failure. His resting heart rate (HR) was 70/min and blood pressure measured 130/80 mmHg.
Most of his preoperative blood investigations including coagulation profile were within normal limits except random blood sugar which was 164 mg/dl. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed Q waves in leads II, III and aVF and ST segment depression in leads V1 -V6. The preoperative chest X-ray was normal. Two-dimensional echo done on admission revealed akinetic inferior and mid-posterior wall; hypokinetic basal, posterior wall, mid and distal interventricular septum; mildly dilated LV and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <25%.
Two months ago, a detailed cardiac work up of the patient had been done wherein a coronary angiogram revealed anomalous origin of the LAD from RCA and absent left main coronary artery (). Thallium scan also showed LVEF of 25% at rest tomography angiography showed a common ostium for RCA and LAD ().
Chronic total occlusion of RCA (after giving off LAD) as well as a short, narrowed out left circumflex (LCx) artery resulted in complete loss of viable myocardium in their corresponding territories. Thus, the myocardium had its blood supply from LAD and partly from LCx artery.
The patient was on medical management as coronary revascularization could not be considered owing to the semi-emergent nature of surgery and that most of the myocardium was already compromised. The patient's relatives were initially reluctant to give their consent for the procedure, thereby causing delay in surgical intervention. Until then, the patient was managed conservatively on continuous Ryle's tube aspiration, intravenous fluids and antibiotics.
All the prescribed medications were continued preoperatively except aspirin and clopidogrel, which were stopped at admission. Low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 60 mg subcutaneously twice daily) was started. It was discontinued 24 hours prior to surgery. The patient was hemodynamically stable and co-operative. Therefore, sequential epidural combined with local infiltration of the surgical site with 0.25% bupivacaine was selected as the anesthetic technique. Central venous pressure (CVP), arterial blood pressure (ABP), blood gas analysis and continuous cardiac output (CO) monitoring (Edwards Life sciences FloTrac monitor) were used along with routine monitors. The baseline ABP, HR, CVP, CO were 122/72 mmHg, 90/min, 7 mmHg and 7 L/min respectively. An epidural catheter was inserted in T10 -T11 interspace with the patient in sitting position. This provided sufficient analgesia and motor blockade for surgery. The surgical site was also infiltrated with 10 ml of 2% lignocaine. The patient was on spontaneous ventilation with tittrated mild sedation with fentanyl and midazolam. Total fluid administered was 1.5 L (1 L of normal saline; 500 ml of colloid). It was guided by CVP, stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV) and CO on the Edwards Sciences FloTrac Vigileo monitor. The patient remained hemodynamically stable until about 50 min of the start of surgery when ABP was 86/54 (65mmHg) and CO was 3 L/min probably due to last epidural bolus of bupivacaine. This was not accompanied by any ECG changes. CVP remained normal. Blood loss was minimal. Ionotropic support (nor-adrenaline 0.07 μg/kg/min) was then started. Thereafter, ABP stabilized and serial ABG's done during surgery were normal. The surgical procedure included resection of gangrenous segment of bowel, anastomosis and anatomical repair of hernia, which lasted approximately 2 h.
Postoperatively, 12 lead ECG was done, which showed no fresh changes. Trop-T done after 12 h of surgery was also negative. Intensive monitoring (ABP, CVP, ECG, and CO) was continued for 48 h postoperatively. The ionotropic support was tapered and discontinued after 36 h of surgery to maintain a mean ABP of 75-80 mm Hg. Analgesia was maintained with epidural infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine with100 mcg fentanyl in 50 ml of normal saline titrated to effect and hemodynamics, intravenous analgesics (diclofenac 75 mg 8 hourly and tramadol whenever required). All preoperative medications including enoxaparin (60 mg sc twice daily for 2 days) and Aspirin were restarted on the 1st postoperative day (POD) and review done by a cardiologist and an endocrinologist. Epidural catheter was removed on the 2nd POD after which clopidogrel was resumed. The course of stay in the surgical intensive care unit (48 h) and later in the ward was uneventful. The patient was discharged on the 5th POD.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?

The diarrhea was watery and continuous of 1-day duration accompanied by chills. He denied shortness of breath or chest pain.
Our patient was hospitalized in another facility 14 days before presenting to the emergency department of our hospital, and was found to have Candida parapsilosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa endocarditis. A 2D echocardiogram was done there and showed vegetation of the prosthetic mitral valve, with normal aortic prosthesis. He was discharged with a peripherally inserted catheter (PIC) line and on intravenous antibiotics namely, tobramycin, cefepime and fluconazole. No valve replacement was performed at that time due to ongoing injection drug use. He was only out for 1 day before presenting to our emergency department.
His past medical history was significant for aortic and mitral valve replacement 1 year before this hospitalization for endocarditis. He also had stage 3 chronic kidney disease.
At initial presentation, he was found to be febrile at 100.3°F and hypotensive at a blood pressure of 85/50. His physical examination revealed a 3/6 systolic murmur in the aortic area with radiation to the precordium, and a 2/6 diastolic murmur over the mitral area without radiation.
His initial laboratory investigations showed white blood cell count of 19.2 k/μL with 93% neutrophils, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 26 mg/dL, creatinine 2.2 mg/dL, serum bicarbonate 16 mmol/L, chloride 112 mmol/L, sodium 136 mmol/L, magnesium 1.2 mmol/L. Prothrombin time was 15 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.17. Urine toxicology screen was positive for benzodiazepines. Troponin level was 2.2 ng/mL (normal<0.4). Initial blood cultures were drawn in the emergency department and later grew P. aeruginosa susceptible to amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and tobramycin. Serology was positive for Hepatitis C infection and negative for HIV infection.
On presentation, he was admitted to the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of septic shock. He was started on intravenous vancomycin, tobramycin, micafungin and cefepime.
Three sets of blood cultures grew C. parapsilosis susceptible to fluconazole, itraconazole and 5 flucytosine, and P. aeruginosa susceptible to amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and tobramycin.
A 2D echocardiogram showed a bioprosthetic aortic valve with a medium, 10 mm, pedunculated, highly mobile vegetation of the aortic valve attached to the posterior aortic annulus. There was no significant aortic valvular regurgitation. There was mild mitral valvular regurgitation.
At day 2 of hospitalization, a transesophageal echocardiogram was done. It showed no aortic abscess but small, 5 mm, mobile vegetation of the aortic valve attached to the non-coronary cusp without significant regurgitation. It also showed large, 10 mm, mobile mitral valve vegetation attached to the anterior leaflet without significant regurgitation.
The hospital course was complicated by acute renal failure and acute heart failure for which the patient was aggressively resuscitated. He was electively intubated and medically stabilized to undergo valve replacement 5 days later. Ethical and logistic considerations were the focus of an extensive discussion among the different treating medical and surgical teams given the active injecting drug use while being treated for a relapse of infective endocarditis. The decision was finally made to proceed with the valve replacement surgery. The patient was kept in hospital for the duration of intravenous antibiotics to ensure adherence to therapy and to prevent use of the intravenous access for illicit drug use.
At day 7 of hospitalization, he underwent aortic and mitral valve replacement. Cultures from the valves also grew P. aeruginosa and C. parapsilosis. All blood cultures drawn after day 1 were negative.
Tobramycin and cefepime were given for 6 weeks postoperatively. Tobramycin trough levels were measured frequently to ensure therapeutic levels. Micafungin was given for 5 days postoperatively, and replaced by anidulafungin that was given for 26 days. Fluconazole was given for 30 days postoperatively while in hospital and prescribed for 3 months after discharge from the hospital.
Throughout hospitalization, he remained afebrile and euvolemic without symptoms of heart failure. Two weeks after discharge from the hospital, he returned to the infectious disease clinic, being in good health, without history of fever, excess sweating, chest pain or shortness of breath. Follow-up blood cultures were drawn and were negative.",What is the patient's delta ratio?

The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 100.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 100.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 100.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 100.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 100.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 100.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 25.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 25.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 25.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 25.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 25.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 25.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 25.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.The concentration of albumin is 4.3 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 12.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.3 (in g/dL)) = 11.25 mEq/L.

Vital signs in the ED were temperature, 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit; blood pressure, 116/66 mmHg; heart rate, 130 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 30; oxygen saturation, 85% on 2 l nasal cannula; weight, 162 kg and body mass index, 47. Physical examination revealed a morbidly obese male in acute respiratory distress with an irregularly irregular pulse and one plus lower extremity pitting oedema. Laboratory values in the ED include white blood cell count, 9 800/μl; haemoglobin, 14.2 g/dl; platelet count, 230 000/μl; sodium, 140 mEq/l; potassium, 4.5 mEq/l; chloride, 104 mEq/l; bicarbonate, 29 mEq/l; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 38 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.4 mg/dl; glucose, 105 mg/dl; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 51 U/l; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 40 U/l; alkaline phosphatase, 68 U/l; total bilirubin, 1.5 mg/dl; albumin, 3.4 g/dl; total protein, 7.1 g/dl; international normalised ratio (INR), 1.2; myoglobin, 97 μg/l; troponin, 0.07 ng/ml and B-type natriuretic peptide, 934 pg/ml. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Arterial blood gas showed a pH 7.33, paCO2 68.5 and paO2 88.6 on FiO2 of 40%. Electrocardiogram confirmed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Echocardiogram revealed a myopathic severely enlarged left ventricular chamber with moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and severe global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 8 to 10%. The patient's work of breathing and oxygenation improved with Bipap. He was started on diltiazem and diuresis was initiated. The patient was admitted to the step-down unit with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.
On hospital day number eight, the overnight nurse found the patient unresponsive. A code blue was called. His initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation and he was shocked with 200 J twice before regaining pulses. When stabilised, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he regained consciousness and full neurologic function within one hour of the event. The following day, an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) was placed. Intraoperatively, the patient had runs of ventricular tachycardia with hypotension to 80 mmHg systolic. Postoperatively, the patient was found to have a right fixed mid-dilated pupil, flaccid paralysis of the left arm and leg with hyperreflexia throughout the left side. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed a right midbrain and thalamic stroke thought to be secondary to transient arrhythmia-induced hypoperfusion, intraoperatively.
On postoperative day number three, after AICD placement and stroke, the patient acutely developed a rigid distended board-like abdomen with dullness to percussion. Vitals at that time were temperature, 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit; blood pressure, 112/67 mmHg; heart rate range, 55 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 26 on ventilator settings of assist control volume control with a rate of 26; tidal volume, 500 ml; FiO2, 40% and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5. His peak inspiratory pressure on the ventilator had risen from 26 to 72 mmHg; his plateau had risen from 15 to 48 mmHg with oxygen desaturation from 93 to 85%. The patient had received 1.5 l in and urinated 4.5 l over the 24 hours, leading up to this event. His laboratory values from that morning were unchanged from previous (white blood count, 10 400/μl; haemoglobin, 12.6 g/dl; platelets, 200 000/μl; sodium, 139 mEq/l; potassium, 4.7 mEq/l; chloride, 100 mEq/l; bicarbonate, 34 mEq/l; BUN, 36 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.41 mg/dl; glucose, 78 mg/dl; calcium, 8.3 mg/dl; magnesium, 2.0 mEq/l; phosphorus, 3.0 mg/dl; AST, 77 U/l; ALT, 94 U/l; alkaline phosphatase, 186 U/l; total bilirubin, 1.3 mg/dl). This constellation of findings prompted the team to measure an abdominal compartment pressure which was elevated to 53 cm H2O (40 mmHg) with an abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) of 42 mmHg. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed which showed no dilated loops of bowel, no ileus, no evidence of free air, abscess or obstruction and minimal free fluid []. Pertinent labs from the event revealed a lactate of 1.0 mg/dl; lipase, 159 U/l; amylase, 76 U/l; creatinine, 1.53 mg/dl. Surgery was consulted and the FiO2 was increased to 100%, which improved his oxygen saturation to 96% despite his elevated peak inspiratory pressures.
Surgical recommendations were for an emergent bedside surgical abdominal decompression. The patient was administered 10 mg of intravenous cisatracurium besylate by anaesthesia in preparation for surgical management. Shortly following paralytic administration, his peak inspiratory pressure corrected from 72 to 23 mmHg, his plateau pressure from 48 to 16 mmHg and his oxygenation status tolerated a decrease in FiO2 down to 40% with his oxygen saturation returning to baseline. Measurement of his abdominal compartment pressure revealed a drop from 53 (40 mmHg) to 23 cm H2O (17 mmHg) and then normalised to 15 cm H20 (11 mmHg) over a three-hour period. During this entire event, the patient averaged 100 to 200 cc/hr of urine output and laboratory values from the following day showed a drop in creatinine from 1.53 to 1.29 mg/dl. Given this correction, surgical management was postponed and the patient was monitored. The patient remained hospitalised for an additional 73 days. He was ultimately transferred to a skilled nursing facility without return of symptoms.",What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?

Thyroid ultrasonography (US) revealed heterogeneous diffuse goiter without any nodules, cysts, or abscess (Figure ). Doppler US revealed a hypovascular thyroid goiter (Figure ), thus confirming the diagnosis of subacute painful thyroiditis.
The patient was admitted to the progressive care unit for sepsis secondary to community-acquired pneumonia, E. coli bacteremia, and subacute painful thyroiditis. She was treated with IV fluids (initially 30 cc/kg bolus then 100 cc/hr maintenance), antibiotics, acetaminophen, and propranolol 20 mg every six hours.

His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.

The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 135.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 135.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 135.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 135.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 89.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 89.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 89.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 89.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 89.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 89.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 5.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 5.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 5.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 5.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 5.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 5.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 135.0 mEq/L - (89.0 mEq/L + 5.0 mEq/L) = 41.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 41.0 mEq/L.The concentration of albumin is 4.5 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 41.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.5 (in g/dL)) = 39.75 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 39.75 mEq/L.Plugging in 39.75 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 39.75 - 12 = 27.75 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 27.75 mEq/L."
859,66,Albumin Corrected Delta Gap,lab test,decimal,pmc-6164201-1,Extracted,"A 14-year-old girl came to Thammasat University Hospital for renal replacement therapy. She presented with end-stage renal disease (oliguria, anemia, and failure to thrive). She was the first child of healthy nonconsanguineous Thai parents. She was born at term to a 23-year-old mother and a 25-year-old father. Her prenatal and perinatal periods were uncomplicated. Her development was unremarkable until six months of age. She clawed by using her knees and elbows, instead of hands, at the age of 8 months. She was unable to walk on her feet but moved on her knees during her childhood period. She came to our hospital at the age of 12 years. Her weight was 25.4 kilograms (below the 3rd percentile) and her sitting height was 70 cm (below the 3rd percentile). Her vitals were normal, except high blood pressure at 120/80 mmHg (above 99th percentile for her age, sex, and height). She had pallor. Her distinctive facial features were the cloudy cornea, exophthalmos, underdeveloped ala nasi, maxillary hypoplasia, and micrognathia (). Upper extremity deformities included shortening of arms and forearms, flexion contracture of elbows, distorted wrists, and shortening of all fingers. Deformities of lower extremities were short thighs, short-bowed legs, and flexion contracture of knee. Distorted and restricted in motion of ankles, and deformities of feet were observed. Her heart, lungs, abdomen, and neurological examination were unremarkable. Her cognitive was appropriated with age.
Her initial investigations demonstrated blood urea nitrogen 120 mg/dL, serum creatinine 8.3 mg/dL, Na 134, K 4.5, Cl 95, HCO3 11 mmol/L, phosphate 2.6, calcium 3.8 mg/dL, albumin 6.0 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 13.5 U/L, with parathyroid hormone (PTH) level at 94 pg/ml. Her radiography of the upper extremities showed absence of carpal bones, osteolytic lesions of metacarpal, and distal ends of ulna and radial bones (). The radiography of the lower extremities demonstrated absence of tarsal bones, osteolytic lesions of metatarsal bones, and distal end of fibula (). In addition, severe cortical thinning of all bones indicating osteopenia was observed (Figures and ).
Ultrasonography showed small size of both kidneys and echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy. The diagnosis of end-stage renal disease was made with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 7 mL/min/1.73 m2. All clinical presentation and investigations were compatible with the clinical diagnosis of MCTO. She received hemodialysis followed by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and medications including erythropoietin, ferrous fumarate, 0.50 µg of calcitriol, and 1400 mg of elemental calcium. Six months later, she developed generalized tonic-clonic seizure from hypercalcemia (12.4 mg/dL). Her serum chemistry demonstrated normal serum phosphorus level (3.9 mg/dL) and low serum alkaline phosphatase (4 U/L), with normal serum PTH level at 103 pg/mL. These findings indicated a marked reduction in the bone uptake of calcium after a period of calcium supplement. Calcium and calcitriol were discontinued until serum calcium returned to normal level, then only 720 mg of elemental calcium was reintroduced. Two years later, she had a slightly high serum calcium level (10.8 mg/dL), normal serum phosphorus level (3.5 mg/dL), and normal PTH level (113 pg/ml). Interestingly, during the past 2 years, we observed persistently low serum ALP levels (2.6–4.9 U/L) [], indicating poor osteoblastic activity and limited bone formation. Thus, impaired bone mineralization from dysregulation of osteoblast and osteoclast was suspected and MAFB mutation might be responsible for MCTO disease in this patient.
We performed a genetic testing, MAFB sequencing on her and her parental blood. The genomic were isolated from peripheral lymphocytes using Puregene DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A short region of the amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain of the MAFB gene, containing mutation hotspots, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We designed primers by using software (Primer3Plus). The forward and reverse primer sequences for PCR amplification were 5′-GCTCAAGT TCGACGTGAAGA-3′ and 5′-GTAGTTGCTCGCCATCCAGT-3′, respectively. PCR products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel and purified using DyeEx 2.0 spin kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The products were then sequenced by capillary electrophoresis. This study was approved by the ethic committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University, Thailand (MTU-EC-PE-1-005/59).
We identified a de novo heterozygous missense mutation at nucleotide 197 from C to G (NM_005461.4; c.197C > G; ), predicting the change of amino acid at codon 66 from serine to cysteine (p. Ser66Cys). There was negative in both mother and father's result. This missense mutation occurred within the transactivation domain of MafB protein. This serine at the codon 66 is evolutionarily conserved among species, and in silico prediction of pathogenicity programs classify this variant as deleterious (SIFT) and probably damaging (PolyPhen).",What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?

He had his last chemotherapy session for the multiple myeloma over 3 months ago and was lost to follow-up since that time period. Symptomatically, he was complaining of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for 3 days after returning from a trip to Haiti.
Initial vital signs included temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 90 beats per minute, blood pressure 86/40 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 100% on 2 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula. Labs showed a white blood cell count of 2.85 × 103/μL, hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit 25.5%, platelets 43 × 103/μL, segmented neutrophils 76%, bands 8%, and lymphocytes 12%. Comprehensive metabolic panel showed sodium 144 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 119 mmol/L, bicarbonate 12 mmol/L, BUN 31 mg/dL, creatinine 3.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 units/L, aspartate aminotransferase 55 units/L, alanine aminotransferase 65 units/L, and albumin 2 g/dL. Initial X-ray and CT of the chest did not indicate any acute infiltrates. A CT of the abdomen showed mild circumferential wall thickening of the colon extending from the cecum to the rectum indicative of colitis. Aggressive IV fluid hydration was initiated and he was empirically started on piperacillin-tazobactam. Initial blood cultures preliminarily grew gram negative rods, at which time levofloxacin was added to his regimen.
Within 48 hours of admission he began to experience worsening respiratory distress and severe tachypnea, with ABG indices showing a pH of 7.26, pCO2 of 43, pO2 of 64, base excess of (−8), and O2 saturation of 91%. Patient was switched to a nonrebreather. He was found to be fluid overloaded with a significant positive fluid balance. The patient had to be placed on BiPap and diuresed with bumetanide. Repeat chest X-ray indicated new right upper lobe infiltrates. After being stabilized he was weaned back to 4 L of O2 via nasal cannula.
Blood culture identification showed growth of Vibrio cholerae non-O1/non-O139. Based on identification and susceptibility studies, antibiotic treatment was deescalated to intravenous levofloxacin. The bacterial strain was isolated and identified by the Florida Department of Health in Jacksonville, FL.
However, the patient's clinical status once again deteriorated. He began to develop episodes of copious hemoptysis and worsening thrombocytopenia. Intermittent platelet transfusions and a trial of desmopressin were started; however no significant increase in platelet count was seen. Patient's respiratory status continued to worsen through his course progressing to respiratory failure requiring emergent intubation. He continued to have bloody secretions suctioned from the endotracheal tube. Chest X-rays indicated worsening bilateral fluffy infiltrates. In the setting of continued bloody secretions it was felt that the radiological findings may correlate with pulmonary hemorrhage.
Patient was sent to the operating room for tracheostomy placement and oral packing by the otolaryngologist. Secondary to the extensive amount of oropharyngeal bleeding, vaginal pads were required. The patient was also started on aminocaproic acid, a fibrinolytic inhibitor without any significant improvement. He continued to require full ventilator support and was too hemodynamically unstable to attempt weaning from the ventilator. As his clinical status deteriorated further, he became less responsive and comatose. A CT of the brain revealed a 2 cm hemorrhage in the left cerebellum with mild surrounding edema. He later underwent cardiac arrest and was unable to be revived, ultimately succumbing to his illness.",What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?

The generalized weakness was gradual in onset and more marked in legs, so much so that she was unable to rise from the bed. She also felt difficulty in swallowing and in subsequent days, difficulty even voiding urine. She also complained of loose stools 4 to 5 times a day, semisolid in consistency. No mucous and no blood was noticed. However, these were associated with occasional abdominal cramps. In systemic inquiry, she did not complain of fever, sore throat, rashes, joint pain, swelling, cough, chest pain, dysuria, hematemesis or backache.
In the past history, she experienced similar episodes intermittently over the last five years. During these episodes, she used to develop generalized weakness, more of lower limbs, vomiting, and sometimes muscle cramps. With these complaints, she often visited doctors and also required admission in private hospitals, where she was given intravenous (IV) fluids with potassium and her weakness improved. Then she was discharged on potassium containing tablets which would relieve her symptoms. After recovery from the episodes, she used to discontinue oral potassium supplements. She used to remain well for 6 to 8 months before she developed another similar episode and treated similarly. In this way, she recalled 4 to 5 admissions. Record of some investigations seen showed that the predominant abnormality was low potassium level in the serum with normal renal functions.
Drug history was remarkable for tablet NeoK, capsule Esomeprazole, multivitamin syrup and tablet motilium. She is the only daughter with two brothers who enjoy good health. No family history of similar disease was elicited. Parents were non-consanguineous. She studied till ninth class and then left study due to the recurrent illness. She was not addicted to narcotics. She had adequate appetite and sleep.
On examination, she had short stature, lean built, and looked wasted and sick. Her pulse was 88 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP), 90/60 mm Hg, temperature, 98.6°F and respiratory rate, 20 breaths per minute. She was not pale looking, icteric or cyanosed. No koilonychia or clubbing was noted. Dehydration was positive, and muscles were wasted.
Her abdomen was soft, non tender, with palpable bladder but no other visceromegaly. The chest was clear. Both heart sounds were audible in all four areas. No added sounds were noted. In central nervous system (CNS) examination, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was15/15; power was 3/5 in both lower limbs, 4/5 in upper limbs with intact sensation. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished in all 4 limbs.
A clinical differential of malabsorption, periodic hypokalemic paralysis, or salt-losing nephropathy was contemplated.
On laboratory investigations, serum urea was 73 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.72 mg/dl; sodium, 127 mEq/L; potassium, 1.4 mEq/L; chloride, 101 mEq/L; and bicarbonate, 09 mEq/L. Her hemogram showed hemoglobin (Hb) of 15.1 g/dl; total leucocyte count (TLC), 37.4×109/L; and platelets, 494×109/L. Urine analysis revealed pH of 7.00; albumin, 2+; pus cells, occasional; and red blood cells (RBCs), numerous. Further biochemical tests showed serum calcium, 6.4 mg/dl; phosphorus, 3.2 mg/dl; serum albumin, 1.8 g/dl; total bilirubin, 0.86 mg/dl; direct bilirubin, 0.08 mg/dl; alkaline phosphatase, 50 IU/L; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), 14 IU/L; serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), 6 IU/L; and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), 7 IU/L.
Ultrasound abdomen showed both sided normal size kidneys with mild pelvicalyceal dilatation bilaterally. Bladder was distended with approximate volume of 430 ml. Chest X-ray was done, which was unremarkable (). Electrocardiography done showed flattening of T waves with occasional inversion in some leads, findings typically seen in hypokalemia ().
She was catheterized, rehydrated with isotonic saline with KCL, and IV antibiotics started on suspicion of urinary tract infection (UTI) as TLC was high. She maintained good urinary output (>1500 ml). By admission day 5, diarrhea had settled. Repeat laboratory tests at this time showed: serum urea of 47 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.6 mg/dl; potassium, 2.5 mEq/L and sodium, 127 mEq/L.
Further investigations showed serum magnesium of 1.02 mg/dl. IV magnesium sulphate was administered daily with modest elevation in serum levels during subsequent days. Potassium requirement remained high and was administered by oral and IV routes. On admission day 10, her serum creatinine was 0.85 mg/dl; potassium, 2.6 mEq/L; and magnesium, 0.95 mg/dl. The temporal changes in serum magnesium and potassium are shown in . The 24-h urinary metabolic study on day 10th of admission showed potassium, 44 mmol/24h; magnesium, 50 mg/ 24 h; calcium, 108 mg/24 h (normal range: 100 to 300 mg/24 h). Fractional excretion of magnesium was 27.3%. In the face of low serum magnesium, fractional magnesium excretion should be less than 2%.
Her gastrointestinal (GI) workup was also done including upper GI endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. Upper GI endoscopy revealed normal mucosa, with mild antral erythema. Sigmoidoscopy showed normal mucosa. Tissue biopsies were also obtained. The duodenal biopsy showed mild stunting of villi with slightly increased intraepithelial lymphocytes; the antrum showed mild chronic nonspecific gastritis and the rectosigmoid, mild nonspecific colitis.
Anti-trangultaminase antibodies and anti-deamidated gliadin-derived peptide antibodies were negative. Final diagnosis was made of GS along with changes of tropical sprue on duodenal biopsy. Genetic testing could not be done due to non-availability of the test.
She was discharged on third January 2014 on tablet spironolactone 25 mg, once daily, increased subsequently to 50 mg; tablet Neok, 2 tablets, 8-hourly, capsule magnesium chloride 1 capsule, 8-hourly, tablet folic acid 5 mg, once daily, tablet Ciproxin 250 mg, 12-hourly.

No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.
The patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.
Six months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.",What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?

Upon physical examination, the patient appeared pale and was noted to have tachycardia, hypotension, and hematochezia. He denied any recent alcohol intake, chest pain, abdominal pain, and abdominal or rectal trauma. Vital signs consisted of a blood pressure of 84/33 mmHg, heart rate of 118 bpm, room air saturation of 92%, and temperature of 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit (37.1 degrees Celsius). He was admitted to the medical ICU for hypovolemic shock secondary to massive bleeding that required immediate endotracheal intubation for airway protection. An initial blood work showed a hemoglobin count of 13.9 g/dL, white blood cell count of 18.7 K/UL, platelet count of 159 K/UL, sodium of 140 mmol/L, potassium of 3.8 mmol/L, chloride of 101 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 10 mmol/L, calcium of 2.2 mmol/L, albumin of 2.7 g/dL, CRP of 233 mg/L, ESR of 36 mm/hr, BUN of 17 mg/dL (6.07 mmol/L), creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL (132.6 Umol/L), lactic acid of 17.0 mmol/L, BNP of 1140.63 pg/ml, total bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL, troponins of 0.020 ng/mL, and CK-MB of 408 ng/mL. Resuscitation was initiated with administration of isotonic solutions, blood transfusions, and initiation of vasoactive medications, and pantoprazole drip was provided. An initial urgent endoscopy revealed a bleeding Dieulafoy lesion, which was immediately clipped. Acute kidney injury was addressed with aggressive fluid resuscitation as evident by increase in BUN of 33 mg/dL (11.78 mmol/L) and creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL (256.33 Umol/L). CT scan of abdomen performed to rule out ischemic colitis in the setting of progressive abdominal distention showed a diffuse pericolonic inflammation most pronounced at the rectosigmoid colon. Repeat endoscopy showed multiple ulcerated lesions of the gastric mucosa () with a biopsy that revealed necrotic debris with acute leukocytic exudate and numerous variably sized, 90-degree angulated fungal hyphae favoring mucormycosis (). Intravenous liposomal amphotericin-B (5 mg/kg/day at 60 kg weight) was started at a dose of 300 mg daily. Due to deterioration of renal function on the second day, treatment was switched to oral suspension of posaconazole at a dose of 400 mg twice a day for a total of 6 days (of note, no levels of posaconazole were drawn during hospital course). Repeat CT scan of the abdomen showed mild-to-moderate hydroureter with hydronephrosis and bladder wall thickening Figures and . Cystoscopy showed distorted anatomy of bladder lumen with multiple mounds of tissues all throughout the bladder most notable in the trigone with failure to locate ureteral orifices. Random biopsies taken from the bladder tissue also showed necrotic debris with active inflammatory and numerous variably sized angulated fungal hyphae consistent with Mucorales species. Once bladder biopsy confirmed Mucor spp, treatment was switched from posaconazole to intravenous isavuconazonium sulfate at a dose of 372 mg every eight hours for 48 hours as loading dose and then to an oral dose of 372 mg daily. Unfortunately, no sensitivity of the isolate to the newer triazoles was available. Surgical approach was considered; however, given patient's frail state and multiple comorbidities, such approach was deferred. Hydronephrosis significantly improved after placement of bilateral nephrostomy tubes. In addition, continuous bladder irrigation with amphotericin-B was given for localized bladder infection for a total of 5 days. A three-way Foley catheter was inserted for continuous amphotericin-B bladder irrigation where 200 ml of medication was administered via catheter; then, the catheter was clamped for 90 minutes and drained to gravity every six hours. After three weeks of systemic treatment with antifungals, a third endoscopy showed only inflammatory changes with a pathologic report, in which mucormycosis was no longer appreciated. His kidney function improved and remained stable after clamping and removal of his nephrostomy tubes. The patient completed 6 months of therapy with 372 mg of oral isavuconazonium sulfate per day. He is currently at home with resolution of his symptoms and no clinical evidence of relapse after 12 months since completion of his treatment.",What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?

The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 140.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 101.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 101.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 101.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 101.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 101.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 101.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 10.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 10.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 10.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 10.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 10.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 10.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 140.0 mEq/L - (101.0 mEq/L + 10.0 mEq/L) = 29.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 29.0 mEq/L.The concentration of albumin is 2.7 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 29.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 2.7 (in g/dL)) = 32.25 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 32.25 mEq/L.Plugging in 32.25 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 32.25 - 12 = 20.25 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 20.25 mEq/L.Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 20.25 mEq/L / 14.0 mEq/L = 1.44643.

Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.
His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.
