6,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-5526772-1,Extracted,"A 41-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital with liver damage, itchy skin, and pyrexia. His medical history was unremarkable, but one year previously his gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels had risen to 271 IU/L (normal: < 30 IU/L). Prior to this, the patient had consumed 540 mL of sake three times a week, and he had been reducing the amount of alcohol he consumed for about one year. He did not smoke or take any recreational drugs. He was single, was not homosexual, and he had not had sexual intercourse for over one year.
The patient had undergone treatment of his internal hemorrhoids as an outpatient at a nearby hospital that comprised an aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) injection. He developed a fever of 38 °C, dark colored urine, and itchy skin on postoperative day (POD) 1, and he took loxoprofen sodium, as required. He consulted another doctor on POD 7, because the symptoms had not improved, and his blood test results led to a diagnosis of liver dysfunction. His liver dysfunction had not improved by POD 14, and he was admitted to our hospital on POD 15.
The patient was 167 cm tall and weighed 52.5 kg. He presented with a blood pressure of 103/59 mmHg, a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, a temperature of 36.6 °C, and 99% oxygen saturation in room air. No specific physical findings were evident during the clinical examination on the day of hospitalization, but the patient had a rash, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and jaundice. The subjective symptoms, comprising the fever, dark colored urine, and itchy skin, had disappeared by POD 10.
The laboratory test results showed that the patient’s complete blood count was almost normal with a white blood cell count of 6900 cells/μL, a hemoglobin concentration of 14.7 g/dL, a hematocrit level of 43.1%, and a platelet count of 3.98 × 105 cells/μL, but a higher percentage of eosinophils was present (6.8%) (normal: 1.0%-5.0%), which peaked at 13.9% on POD 20. The patient’s serum liver enzyme and bilirubin levels were elevated at the time of admission. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 432 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was 911 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was 473 IU/L (normal: 115-359 IU/L), and the total bilirubin level was 1.3 mg/dL (normal: 0.2-1.2 mg/dL). Thus, compared with the ALP level, the AST and ALT levels showed greater magnitudes of elevation. The patient’s other blood test results were within the normal ranges, as follows: serum albumin: 4.0 g/dL (normal: 3.8-5.2 g/dL); serum creatinine: 0.86 mg/dL (normal: 0.65-1.09 mg/dL); C-reactive protein: 0.1 mg/dL (normal: 0-0.3 mg/dL); prothrombin time: 100% (normal: 80%-120 %); thyroid-stimulating hormone: 0.5 μIU/mL (normal: 0.34-4.04 μIU/mL); triiodothyronine: 2.98 pg/dL (normal: 2.36-5.00 pg/dL); and thyroxin: 1.18 ng/dL (normal: 0.88-1.67 ng/dL). The serological tests for autoantibodies generated weakly positive results (1:40) for anti-nuclear antibodies, and negative results for anti-smooth muscle and anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Negative results were obtained from the tests for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen, the hepatitis C virus antibody, rapid plasma reagin, the anti-Epstein-Barr virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, and the anti-cytomegalovirus IgM antibody, and from the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test. The IgG level was within the normal range at 1415 mg/dL (normal: 800-1600 mg/dL) and the IgM level was within the normal range at 100 mg/dL (normal: 60-250 mg/dL). The IgE level was elevated at 1333 mg/dL (normal: < 250 mg/dL). Chest radiography did not reveal any abnormalities. No morphological changes were evident following abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and abdominal computed tomography (Figure ).
When the patient was hospitalized, we considered viral, alcohol-induced, autoimmune, drug-induced, biliary tract, and thyroid function-based diseases as frequent causes of acute liver dysfunction for the differential diagnosis, and, based on the patient’s medical history, and the serological and imaging results, we considered that alcohol and DILI were highly likely causes of the patient’s acute liver dysfunction. However, the patient had stopped drinking during the past year, so we thought that there was a high likelihood of DILI. Therefore, we began conservative treatment with a small amount of extracellular fluid replacement.
Figure presents the patient’s symptoms, laboratory test results, and treatment over the entire course. The liver transaminase and bilirubin levels decreased rapidly after admission, and the maximum levels were as follows: ALT: 950 IU/L on POD 15; AST: 470 IU/L on POD 17; and total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL on POD 17. The ALP and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels showed consistent downward trends from POD 7. The patient's symptoms disappeared on POD 10, and no new symptoms appeared after hospitalization. We performed a liver biopsy on POD 25, and a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) of the components of the ALTA injection and lidocaine on POD 28. The patient was discharged on POD 29, and he was managed as an outpatient without any prescriptions. At the time of the patient’s first outpatient appointment on POD 35, his liver transaminase and bilirubin levels had declined and were almost within the normal ranges.
Figure presents hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)-stained sections of the liver biopsy performed on POD 25. The H and E staining showed that the basic structure of the liver had been maintained without any hepatocyte dropout or disruption, and that the bile duct had not been disrupted. At a higher magnification, the H and E staining showed that the parenchymal cells were partially dilated and that a mild inflammatory cell infiltration was present in the area of the central vein. Neither eosinophil nor plasma cell infiltrations were detected within the liver tissue. Bile plugs were found at multiple sites within the parenchyma and sinusoids. Masson staining did not show the presence of liver tissue fibrosis.
The lymphocyte proliferation activity levels, which were determined from the DLST performed on POD 28, were 676 counts per minute (cpm) for the control and 871 cpm for the ALTA with lidocaine. The stimulation index, which was calculated as the ALTA with lidocaine cpm divided by the control cpm, was 1.29 (normal in Japanese people: < 1.8).","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight. You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.","{'sex': 'Male', 'weight': [52.5, 'kg'], 'height': [167.0, 'cm'], 'creatinine': [0.86, 'mg/dL'], 'age': [41, 'years']}",83.93895,79.742,88.1359,"The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient is 41 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 0.86 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 167.0 cm, which is 167.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.67 m. The patient's weight is 52.5 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 52.5 kg / (1.67 m * 1.67 m) = 18.82463 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 18.8, indicating they are normal weight.
Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 52.5 kg.

Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 41) * 52.5 * 1) / (0.86 * 72) = 83.93895 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 83.93895 mL/min."
19,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-4641361-1,Extracted,"In November 2007, a 49-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital from an orthopaedist complaining of a one year history of sustained difficulty walking and severe bilateral hip pain. Her height was 155.5 cm and body weight was 61.0 kg. Laboratory data showed a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl, potassium 2.8 mmol/l, calcium 9.5 mg/dl, phosphorus 2.5 mg/dl, uric acid 1.5 mg/dl, normoglycaemic glycosuria and metabolic acidemia (pH 7.30, HCO3− 17.4 mmol/l) (Table ). Bilateral transcervical fractures were confirmed by MRI (Fig. ) and bone scintigraphy showed multiple hot spots in her joints and ribs, compatible with osteomalacia (Fig. ). Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was diagnosed clinically from a low serum level of phosphorus, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (11.0 pg/dl), high levels of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (67.5 IU/l), and the findings of bone scintigram, although a bone biopsy was not performed. Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) was ruled out by total body survey with whole body computed tomography or endoscopic surveillances and a normal blood FGF23 (22.1 pg/ml, 10–50 pg/ml) level.
Urinalysis showed pH 6.0 and twenty four hour urine demonstrated a low renal fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphate (Tmp/GFR 0.91), increased fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA 43.9 %) and generalized aminoaciduria.
The calculated anion gap was 12.4 meq/l, with an inappropriately alkaline urine (pH 6.0), suggestive of distal type of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). An intravenous bicarbonate loading test to assess the tubular dysfunction demonstrated that the increased fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FEHCO3− 13.25 %) and urine-blood (UB) Pco2 gradient (U-Bpco2 50.1 mmHg), suggesting the presence of proximal type of RTA. NH4Cl loading test was not performed because of the presence of apparent metabolic acidemia. These biochemical data of blood and urine indicated Fanconi syndrome with proximal type of RTA. Tests for anti-SSA and anti-SSB were negative and serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels were normal. Furthermore, serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis revealed no monoclonal component. Any of the patient’s medication did not seem to be related to Fanconi syndrome. Light microscopic examination of a kidney biopsy demonstrated cellular infiltration of interstitium and proximal tubular epithelium composed mainly of CD3+ lymphocytes without glomerular involvement, consistent with features of TIN (Fig. ,).
The patient was also suspected to be diagnosed as PBC because of high levels of alkaline phosphatase (663 IU/l), high serum IgM levels (1084 mg/dl) and the presence of anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody (1:10). Sequential liver biopsy demonstrated the presence of a periportal cellular infiltrate (Fig. ), compatible with PBC though biochemical liver function was normal. The combination of these findings led to the patient’s diagnosis of osteomalacia caused by TIN with Fanconi syndrome in asymptomatic PBC.
The patient was started on therapy with calcitriol (1 μg/day), neutral potassium phosphate and sodium bicarbonate (6 g/day). She was subsequently administered middle-dose corticosteroid (20 mg/day of predonisolone) and ursodeoxycholic acid (300 mg/day). One year after the treatment, the patient became asymptomatic and renal function remained stable. Furthermore, MRI showed the bilateral transcervical fractures of the femoral neck had almost fully repaired (Fig. ). Treatment is currently being continued in the outpatient clinic.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.
The patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.
The patient is 49 years old. 
The concentration of creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 155.5 cm, which is 155.5 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.555 m. The patient's weight is 61.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 61.0 kg / (1.555 m * 1.555 m) = 25.2272 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 25.2, indicating they are overweight/obese.
Because the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight).
For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
For females, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)
The patient's gender is Female.
The patient's height is 155.5 cm, which is 155.5 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 61.22051 in. 
Plugging in the values for the IBW formula for females gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (61.22051 (in inches) - 60) = 48.30717 kg.
Hence, the patient's IBW is 48.30717 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight).
To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 48.30717 kg + 0.4 * (61.0 kg  - 48.30717 kg) = 53.3843 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 53.3843 kg.
Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:
CrCl = ((140 - age) * weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).
Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 49) * 53.3843 * 0.85) / (1.4 * 72) = 40.96504 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 40.96504 mL/min."
1,2,Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation),lab test,decimal,pmc-7671985-1,Extracted,"An 87-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for anorexia for several days, high-grade fever from the previous day, and liver dysfunction. Of note, he had a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and angina. Physical examination findings included: clear consciousness; height, 163 cm; weight, 48 kg; blood pressure, 66/40 mmHg; heart rate, 75/min; respiratory rate, 22/min; oxygen saturation of peripheral artery, 96%; and body temperature, 38.1 °C. He had no surface lymphadenopathy. Laboratory findings included: white blood cell (WBC) count, 4.2 × 109/L; hemoglobin, 9.6 g/dL; platelet count, 106 × 109/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 1662 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 6562 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 1407 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 509 IU/L; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), 130 IU/L; total bilirubin, 2.7 mg/dL; prothrombin time (PT), 20.3 s; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.73; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 34.4 mg/dL; and creatinine, 1.4 mg/dL. Serologic tests were all negative for hepatitis A, B, C, and E. Computed tomography (CT) performed at admission revealed no distinct nodules or masses in the liver, but mild splenomegaly, multiple hypodense splenic lesions, and para-aortic lymph node swelling (Fig. a–c). Antibiotics were administered intravenously for suspected acute cholangitis and sepsis, but the fever persisted. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 2 days later newly depicted gallbladder wall thickening and ascites (Figs. , ). On the same night, the patient presented with grade II hepatic encephalopathy, with blood tests showing a decrease in platelet count and worsening liver function suggestive of “acute type” ALF with hepatic coma and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). While consideration was being given to treating acute liver failure, the patient suddenly developed ventricular fibrillation and died despite immediate resuscitation measures on day 3 of hospitalization.
Given the rapid clinical course, an autopsy was performed in this patient with suspected ALF likely due to drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis of indeterminate etiology, circulatory disturbance, metabolic disease, or malignant cells including malignant lymphoma. This led to the patient being diagnosed with malignant, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, characterized by multiple lymph-node, as well as multi-organ (i.e., spleen, liver, lung, and prostate) involvement: (1) general swelling of lymph nodes in the para-abdominal aorta (Fig. a), peripancreatic, peribronchial, pulmonary hilar, subclavicular regions, as well as in the pelvis, especially around the iliac arteries, measuring up to 60 mm in diameter; (2) presence of multiple whitish splenic nodules (Fig. b) with the entire spleen shown to be microscopically infiltrated by tumor cells (Fig. a); (3) irregular geographical morphology of the liver (Fig. c) with the lymphoma cells mainly infiltrating the portal areas (Fig. b); (4) involvement of the right lobe of the lung; (5) involvement of both lobes of the prostate consequent to outer connective tissue involvement (Fig. c). Microscopically, the tumor cells in the lymph nodes were shown to have medium-sized irregular nuclei and small nucleoli with a high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, thus showing diffuse proliferation characterized by the presence of large numbers of small T-cells (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry revealed the tumor cells to be positive for CD20 (Fig. a), CD79a (Fig. b), bcl-2 (Fig. c), and MUM1 (Fig. d), but negative for CD3 (Fig. e), CD10, bcl-6, and cyclin D1, with a Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) of 16% (Fig. f). The causes of death were thus determined as (1) DIC and (2) ALF associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

The concentration of creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL. 
The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.
The patient's height is 163.0 cm, which is 163.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.63 m. The patient's weight is 48.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 48.0 kg / (1.63 m * 1.63 m) = 18.06617 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 18.1, indicating they are underweight.
Because the patient is underweight, we take the patient's weight, 48.0 kg as the patient's adjusted weight needed for the Cockroft-Gault Equation.

Fuchsinophilic protein deposition can be found at the mesangial region and subepithelial region, including fibrin crescent formation of one cell. The kidney tubular epithelium exhibited granular and vacuolar degeneration, as well as multifocal atrophy. The renal interstitium showed multishaped lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration, together with mild thickening of the arteriole wall. Paraffin immunofluorescence revealed: Immunoglobulin (Ig) G (++), IgA (++), IgM (++), C3 (+), fall risk assessment (+), C1q (++), and granular deposition along the mesangial region and capillary wall. Combined with clinical findings, this condition was considered diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis, with IV-G (A), AI = 11, and CI = 5. AI was scored as follows: Cellular proliferation (2 points), leukocyte infiltration (1 point), nuclear fragmentation/fibrinoid necrosis (2 points), cell crescent (0 points), Meyer's loop/thrombus (2 points), and interstitial monocyte infiltration (2 points). CI was scored as follows: Sclerosis (2 points), fibrin crescent (0 points), tubular atrophy (2 points), and interstitial fibrosis (2 points) (Figure ).

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.
If the creatinine concentration is less than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL and the patient is female, A = 0.7 and B = -0.241.
If the creatinine concentration is less than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL and the patient is male, A = 0.9 and B = -0.302.
If the creatinine concentration is greater than 0.7 mg/dL and the patient is female, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.
If the creatinine concentration is greater than 0.9 mg/dL and the patient is male, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.

The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 141.4 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 141.4 µmol. To convert 141.4 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 141.4 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.00014 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.00014 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.01584 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.01584 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.01584 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 15.84 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 15.84 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.584 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 141.4 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 1.584 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.
Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.584/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**22 * 1.012 = 47.039.
Hence, the GFR value is 47.039 ml/min/1.73 m²."

There was no history of fever, altered consciousness, seizures, or upper or lower limb weakness. The past medical history was unremarkable. At the time of examination, his BP was 240/130 mm Hg. The fundus examination revealed bilateral papilledema with grade 4 hypertensive changes. The neurological examination revealed normal grade 5 power in all four limbs with normally elicited deep tendon reflexes. The sensory examination was unremarkable with normal flexor plantar response bilaterally. Serum electrolytes were normal; kidney function tests were deranged (blood urea 86 mg/dL, serum creatinine 3.7 mg/dL). A renal biopsy revealed features of IgA nephropathy. MRI of the brain revealed a hyperintense signal of medulla and cervical cord on T2 and FLAIR images (Figures ); small hyperintense foci were also noted in the parieto-occipital regions and deep cerebellar white matter. The lesions were also hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (because of T2 shine-through); there was no evidence of restricted diffusion on apparent diffusion co-efficient maps. As there was no clinical or lab evidence to support the diagnosis of encephalomyelitis or acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) as suggested initially by the radiologist, an atypical variant of PRES was considered as the most plausible diagnostic possibility. Further investigations including CSF studies were not considered necessary in view of the strongly suggestive clinical and imaging features.

Although diagnosed with atrial septal defect (ASD) 30 years previously, the patient elected not to undergo surgical repair. Approximately 1 year prior, he began to visit the pediatric ward of Samsung Medical Center more frequently with symptoms of palpitations and dyspnea lasting 2 to 3 days and occurring in 2- to 3-month intervals. An electrocardiogram showed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and secundum-type ASD (22.3 mm) with a left-to-right shunt was diagnosed by echocardiogram. Device closure (Amplatzer septal occlude 28 mm; AGA Medical, Golden Valley, MN, USA) was then performed; however, 1 week after the procedure, the patient continued to experience dyspnea and chest pain after 10 to 20 minutes of walking. Sustained atrial fibrillation was seen on the electrocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor. Cardioversion was performed following hospitalization with the opinion that the persistent atrial fibrillation was due to device closure. The patient was discharged from the hospital after cardioversion to sinus rhythm at 100 J; however, the symptoms recurred. Since it was difficult to perform radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) due to the recent device closure, the patient was referred to the thoracic surgery department for totally thoracoscopic ablation. Surgery was performed under routine procedures. Intubation was performed using a double lumen endotracheal tube. For the surgery, a 10-mm trocar was inserted in the fourth intercostal space (ICS) of the right anterior axillary line, a 5-mm trocar in the third ICS along the anterior axillary line, and a 10-mm trocar in the sixth ICS on the mid-axillary line. Right pulmonary vein ablation, right ganglionated plexi ablation, and ablation of the right half of the space between the right lower pulmonary vein and the left lower pulmonary vein were performed. Between the procedures, we conducted a high-frequency stimulation test for finding ganglionated plexi. Sutures were placed after chest tube insertion. On the left side, ports were placed in the same positions, and ablations were performed in the same order as on the right side after dividing Marshall’s ligament (). A left atrial auricle resection was then performed using an Echelon Flex 60 articulating endoscopic linear cutter (Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA). Upon confirmation of the conversion to sinus rhythm, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. He was then transferred to the general ward on postoperative day 1 and discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 6. During this 6-day postoperative period, the sinus rhythm was maintained continuously. Six months later, the sinus rhythm was seen on the 24-hour Holter monitor; the patient showed none of the earlier symptoms, and therefore, amiodarone and warfarin were stopped.

He had a prior history of cerebral infarctions (x3) at the age of 66, 74 and 75 years, with a first instance of swallowing difficulties after the third stroke. At that time, dysphasia rehabilitation was initiated within 3 days of the stroke, and he recovered the ability to eat a regular meal within 2 weeks. In January 2018, 1-year after his last stroke, he underwent surgery for spinal stenosis, followed by a 10-day period of bedrest. His physical activity level subsequently declined due to back pain, and he lost 10 kg within the 10 months after surgery. Swallowing difficulties re-emerged in September 2018, with the patient only able to tolerate soft meals. His dysphasia worsened, with an increase in sputum and development of a chronic cough.
His medical history included cerebral infarctions (x3), diabetes mellitus, spinal stenosis, and hypertension. His height was 168.8 cm, with a body weight of 56.5 kg. He had a right hemiplegia, with the following functional measures: grip strength, 25 kg; gait speed, 0.7 m/s, assessed using the 5-m walk test; and skeletal mass index, 6.6 kg/m2. His score of 5 points on the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form was indicative of malnourishment. Absence of another cerebral infarct was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Video-endoscopic swallowing assessment showed saliva pooling in the pharynx, widening of the pharyngeal space, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A). Video-fluorography revealed a decrease in the forward movement of the larynx, a widened pharyngeal space, weakened pharyngeal constriction, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A–C). Functional swallowing scores were as follows: Hyodo score, 9; Fujishima grade, 6; FILS, 8; and dysphasia severity scale, 4. A probable diagnosis of sarcopenic dysphagia was made, based on the criteria defined by Mori et al. [] Clinical management included swallowing training, a high-protein diet, and nutritional guidance. The patient declined additional rehabilitation, due to his previous experience post-stroke. Therefore, we presented laryngeal suspension as a possible alternative treatment, which was performed in December 2018.
Laryngeal suspension was performed via a minimally invasive thyromadibulopexy, using two skin incisions: one (2-cm) incision at the level of the mandible and the other (3-cm) between the hyoid bone and the superior border of the thyroid cartilage (A). Identified the white line, divided aside the anterior cervical muscles, and exposed the thyroid cartilage. Also the mandible was exposed. Two holes in the mandibular and six holes in the thyroid cartilage was made by using drill. The thyroid cartilage was fixed to the mandible using No. 2 nylon. No. 2 nylon thread was passed through the Gore-tex sheet cut to the size of thyroid cartilage. And it was passed through the thyroid cartilage, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, mandible, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, and tied to the other side of the nylon. As the two holes of the middle of the thyroid cartilage, two No. 2 nylons was crossed to fix the thyroid cartilage and mandible. The larynx was suspended about one vertebral body by totally using five No. 2 nylons (B), confirmed by X-ray fluoroscopy. A 1-cm incision was performed for tracheotomy, and cuffed tracheal cannula was inserted for airway management.
Maintaining some neck flexion for a period of 1-week was conducted. Nutritional support was initiated via gastrostomy tube feeding. The cuffed tracheal cannula was changed to an uncuffed cannula on postoperative day (POD) 1. The wound was stable and there was no pain. Swallowing was initiated using jelly and cold tea, with the patient in a flat lateral position. The tracheal cannula was removed on POD 4. Video-fluorography revealed contrast agent residue in the vallecular but with a decrease in residue in the pyriform sinus compared to pre-operative measures, with no evidence of aspiration on POD 6 (A–C). Anterosuperior movement of the larynx was improved, reaching one vertebral level higher than before surgery. The swallowing reflex was maintained, with sufficient opening of the esophageal orifice, avoiding the need for mandibular protrusion to swallow. Swallowing using modified food was initiated in a sitting position on POD 6 and the gastrostomy tube was removed on POD 7. Video-endoscopic examination confirmed his ability to eat a rice cracker and noodles without aspiration and no evidence of pharyngeal residue on POD 11 (B). The patient was able to eat soft meals on POD 14, and a regular meal on POD 18, and was discharged on POD 21. The patient gained 2 kg in the 2 months after surgery, with improvement in functional scores: Hyodo score, 5; Fujishima grade, 8; FILS, 8; and dysphasia severity scale, 6.

She reported some premonitory symptoms of warmth and sweating and gave a history of light-headedness, weakness, and fatigue over the last 2 weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or visual changes. She denied headache or weakness.
Over the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks. She lived alone and had a history of hypertension for almost thirteen years for which she was noncompliant with her medications. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension and died at the age of 80 years from heart disease.
On examination, her temperature was 37°C, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute. Her blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter. Oxygen saturation was 100 percent on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.
Physical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density. She was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and workup.
Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no obvious lesion. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute with no ST or T wave changes. A 24-hour holter monitoring was performed which revealed sinus bradycardia without other arrhythmias.
Her laboratory studies were as shown in .
Serum alcohol levels were undetectable and urine toxicology was negative. Esophagogastro-dudodenoscopy was performed and the gastric biopsy was suggestive of chronic atrophy of the body and fundus. The endoscopic findings were further reinforced by high serum levels of antibodies to intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells confirming malabsorption of vitamin B12 due to lack of intrinsic factor. Thus, the diagnosis of pernicious anemia was established.

A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm) observed in the right ovary ().
The patient was unmarried and wanted to preserve her fertility; therefore, she was advised to visit an infertility hospital for oocyte cryopreservation. The repeated basal hormonal tests were unchanged, and serum levels of androgens including total testosterone, free testosterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were all normal. Induction of superovulation was attempted with a starting dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (Follitrope®; LG, Iksan, Korea) daily for oocyte cryopreservation. The dose of recombinant FSH was increased to 225 IU after one week because follicular development was not observed on ultrasound. However, follicular development was not observed despite the increase in FSH dose, and cycle cancellation was determined at that time. Further evaluation included karyotype, FMR1 premutation, and 21-hydroxylase antibody tests.

He had no respiratory, neurological, rheumatological, ophthalmologic, or dermatological symptoms. Physical examination showed a pale child with weight and height both below the 3rd percentile for age. Laboratory investigations were remarkable for anemia (hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL), ESR 114 mm/h, serum calcium 2.26 mmol/L, and low albumin level 28 g/L. Endoscopy revealed an erosive, friable, and nodular gastric mucosa over the entire stomach. Histopathology of biopsies revealed chronic noncaseating granulomatous inflammation []. Special stains and cultures for acid-fast and fungal microorganisms showed negative results. Colonoscopy was normal including terminal ileum. CT scan of the chest and abdomen demonstrated multiple, small, centrolobularly distributed nodules within the acini of both lungs and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Ophthalmological examination showed evidence of uveitis. ACE level was elevated at 135 U/L. Similar to Case 1, extensive investigations for infectious, immunologic, and inflammatory conditions associated with GIT granulomatous inflammation were negative.
The combination of tissue findings of granulomatous disease from upper GIT, elevated ACE, systemic involvement, and negative workup for infectious disease suggested systemic sarcoidosis with significant GI involvement. The patient received corticosteroids at 1 mg/kg/day and omeprazole, resulting in resolution of GI symptoms and normalization of activity markers and ACE level. Tapering of corticosteroids over 3 months led to relapse of the disease. Again, remission was induced by a course of steroids supplemented by mesalamine (Pentasa 50 mg/kg/day) and azathioprine (up to 2.5 mg/kg/day) to maintain remission. Throughout the 4-year follow up, the course of the disease was punctuated by several relapses on tapering of corticosteroids and later development of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia: hemoglobin 10.6 gm/dL, macrocytosis (MCV 102, normal 80–91 fL), hyperchromasia (MCH 34.5, normal 20–31 pg), low serum vitamin B12 119.2 pmol/L (normal 162–638 pmol/L). Red blood cell folate level was normal at 16.2 nmol/L (normal, 10.4–42.2 nmol/L). Antigastric parietal cell antibodies were negative. The patient received weekly injections of vitamin B12 ( 1 mg weekly) for 6 weeks that raised the level to 231.8 pmol/L with correction of anemia and normalization of his peripheral blood picture.
Considering the steroid dependency of the disease and the short stature of the patient, he was commenced on infliximab 5 mg/kg administered intravenously at 0, 2 and 6 weeks and then every 8 weeks. The patient reported a significant subjective general improvement as well as resolution of his GI symptoms. ESR and ACE concentration returned to normal. A repeat of endoscopy after the 6th dose of infliximab infusion demonstrated loss of gastric folds pattern and loss of normal vascular pattern; otherwise there were no more erosions or friability. Biopsies from the gastric mucosa showed a marked reduction of inflammation, atrophic gastric glands, and absence of granulomas. At 5 years posttreatment with infliximab, the patient remains in remission off corticosteroids.","Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

The patient's normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL.
The concentration of albmumin is 28.0 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 28.0 g albmumin/10.0 dL = 2.8 g albmumin/dL. The concentration value of 28.0 g albmumin/L converts to 2.8 g albmumin/dL. 
The concentration of calcium is 2.26 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of calcium from mmol to mg. The mass of calcium is 2.26 mmol. To convert 2.26 mmol of calcium to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 2.26 mmol calcium * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.00226 mol calcium. To convert from mol calcium to grams, multiply by the molar mass 40.08 g/mol, which will give 0.00226 mol calcium * 40.08 g/mol = 0.09058 g calcium. To convert 0.09058 g of calcium to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.09058 g calcium * 1000.0 mg/g = 90.58 mg calcium. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 90.58 mg calcium/10.0 dL = 9.058 mg calcium/dL. The concentration value of 2.26 mmol calcium/L converts to 9.058 mg calcium/dL. 
Plugging these values into the formula, we get (0.8 * (4.0 g/dL - 2.8 g/dL)) + 9.058 mg/dL = 10.018 mg/dL.

135,8,Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism,risk,integer,pmc-5837304-1,Extracted,"A 41-year-old female patient with a past medical history of bipolar disorder, cocaine use disorder, and tobacco use disorder, presented with increased respiratory distress and combativeness. On initial examination, her vital signs included a temperature of 100.9°F, heart rate of 140 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute and blood pressure of 103/66 mmHg. On physical examination, she was only able to speak in two-word sentences. There were bilateral coarse crackles all over the chest. She did not have any focal neurological deficits. Cardiovascular examination did not reveal abnormal heart sounds. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. The patient was immediately placed on a nonrebreather mask. However, the patient kept taking off her nonrebreather mask, continued to have worsening hypoxia, and eventually required tracheal intubation. Chest radiograph showed right upper lobe pneumonia (Figure ).
She was started on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin, and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was chosen due to patient's critical condition and unclear etiology of the infecting pathogen. The patient had a white cell count of 11.8 x 103/microliter (µL) that trended to 2.2 x 103/µL, normal troponins, and a lactic acid of 1.8 mmol/Liter (L) initially that trended up to 2.5 mmol/L. Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine, benzodiazepine, and opiates. Urine Legionella antigen and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen were negative. Influenza A was positive on rapid antigen testing and the patient was started on oseltamivir. This raised our concern for secondary bacterial pneumonia from MRSA as a complication of influenza virus infection. The patient had computed tomography (CT) of the chest that showed right upper, middle, and lower lobe consolidations with cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma (Figures , ).
Sputum culture and blood cultures grew MRSA that was sensitive to both vancomycin and clindamycin, confirming our diagnosis. Vancomycin had already been started on admission and was continued. Fluid resuscitation was also done early in the course, but eventually progressed to septic shock. The patient was then started on norepinephrine infusion and vasopressin infusion for blood pressure support. She then developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her hypoxia became refractory to conventional ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was considered. She had a transesophageal echocardiogram which showed severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 5%. Her cardiomyopathy was felt to be acute and related to sepsis. She was managed for septic and cardiogenic shock, and venous-arterial ECMO was started. She was also started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for hypervolemia refractory to diuresis, inotropic and vasopressor support. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) five days later showed that the EF recovered to 45%. She continued to remain intubated for 16 days and a repeat CT chest showed worsening and multiple cavitary lesions in the right lung (Figures , ).
A repeat TTE showed EF of 60% and normal left and right heart function. ECMO was stopped and she was decannulated on day 9, CRRT was stopped on day 9. Unfortunately, she did not tolerate withdrawal of ECMO and continued to deteriorate and became difficult to wean from the ventilator. Given her lack of response to vancomycin, she was switched to daptomycin and linezolid, and the vancomycin was discontinued. She did not improve with new antibiotic regimen, continued to accumulate volume, and could not tolerate being off CRRT that was resumed for volume removal. Her hypoxia continued to be refractory despite all efforts.

The patient weighed 102 kg until four years ago, at which time, with the help of a dietitian, he started to lose weight. However, after losing 2 kg, he discontinued the dietary regime. Two years later, when he weighed 100 kg, he decided to lose weight again because he felt uncomfortable with the way he looked and felt very overweight. Within a year, he lost 20 kg by eating less and playing basketball every day for approximately two hours a day. At that time, he had to quit basketball due to a busy school schedule which led to a fear of gaining weight, causing him to restrict his diet even more. By restricting his daily intake to 500 kcal, he had lost 17.5 kg within the last two months before presenting to our clinic. The patient denied having body image problems but agreed that he had an intense fear of gaining weight. Past medical history was unremarkable except for an appendectomy performed when he was 7 years old. The family history revealed that two of his aunts have Hashimoto thyroiditis.
At admission, the patient’s body weight was 60.7 kg (50-75th percentile). Height was 186 cm (>97th percentile) and body mass index was 17.55 kg/m2 (<3rd percentile). His body temperature was 36.1 °C and respiratory rate was 22/min. His supine blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg and heart rate was 40 bpm. His standing blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg and heart rate was 66 bpm. Cardiac examination was normal except for the bradycardia, and other systems were also normal on his physical examination. Meeting the diagnostic criteria of the fourth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV), he was diagnosed with AN-restrictive type and hospitalized due to bradycardia. His laboratory investigations which included complete blood count, liver and kidney function tests, glucose and electrolyte levels, sedimentation rate, cortisol, cholesterol levels, and urinary analysis were all within normal ranges. Thyroid function tests revealed very low TSH levels (0.025 uIU/mL, normal range: 0.27-4.20 uIU/mL), low free T3 (fT3) levels (2.87 pmol/L, normal range 3.10-6.70 pmol/L), and normal free T4 (fT4) levels (21.9 pmol/L, normal range: 12.00-22.00 pmol/L). Thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies were high, while TSH receptor antibodies were negative. With these findings, he was additionally diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Thyroid ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis.
In the inpatient unit, the patient was followed by an interdisciplinary team consisting of a child and adolescent psychiatrist, an adolescent medicine specialist, a pediatric endocrinologist, and a dietitian with special training and experience in adolescent EDs. During his three-week stay, he gained 4 kg. Despite the weight gain and the improvement in his nutritional status, bradycardia continued (40-50 bpm). Echocardiography findings were normal, and Holter monitoring only revealed sinus bradycardia. Thyroid functions were monitored closely without any medical treatment, along with his vitals. Before discharge, while TSH levels were still low (0.018 uIU/mL), fT3 levels were thought to be relatively high (3.76 pmol/L) considering his metabolic status. The patient was discharged with a weight of 64.7 kg. At his follow-up visit 2 months later, the boy had gained weight and weighed 75.1 kg. Due to the gradual increase noted in his TSH levels (from 8.91 to 28.84 uIU/mL), levothyroxine treatment was started. At that time, fT3 and fT4 levels were measured as 7.74 and 4.42 pmol/L, respectively. Two months later, it was learned that he had been using levothyroxine in doses three times higher than the recommended dose. Although monitored closely, due to the drug compliance problems and weight changes with severe body image issues, it was hard to maintain the thyroid levels within a stable course. Stabilization occurred after ten months of therapy when he started using a proper medication schedule and succeeded in preserving his target weight. The course of the thyroid function tests is given in . Bradycardia also improved with the recovery in thyroid hormone levels.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?

During preanesthetic assessment his history revealed that the he required three pillows to support his head due to the disease process and involvement of the cervical spines []. A physical examination suggested that there was severe cervical spondylitis involving thoracolumbar vertebral column, without lower limb neurological involvement. No cardiovascular system abnormality was detected.
The airway examination showed adequate mouth opening with artificial dentures, Mallampati grade III restricted neck mobility. A preoperative assessment for difficult intubation was made.
Radiographs of the vertebral column revealed ankylosis of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinous processes showing posterior joint involvement, resorption of the anterior surfaces of the vertebral bodies and calcification and ossification of the posterior ligaments and surrounding soft tissues.
Following the traditional anesthetic approach to ankylosing patients, we decided to opt for securing the airway using awake endotracheal intubation; however, the patient did not give his consent for this. A difficult intubation cart, which had a selection of oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal airway, gum elastic bougie, fiberoptic bronchoscope, cricothyroidotomy, and other aids, was kept ready.
On the day of the surgery, the patient was premedicated with oral ranitidine 150 mg and diazepam 5 mg, two hours before surgery, with a sip of water, and injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscularly one hour before surgery. Preparation for fiberoptic intubation was done. Nasal patency was checked and the nasal cavity prepared with oxymetazoline nasal drops. In the operation room the patient was made to lie supine with the head adequately supported on three pillows and routine monitors, such as, the electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure, and pulse oximeter and capnograph were placed. The IV line, with a 18 Gauge canula, was started. Anesthesia was induced with IV injection propofol 2 mg/kg, slowly, in titrated doses, with fentanyl 2 μg/kg. The anesthetist had to use a higher footstep than normal to get the desired level. We opted for fiberoptic bronchoscopy, but as the heart rate increased to 144/min and the blood pressure increased to 180/118 mmHg, we administered a further bolus dose of 50 mg of propofol to increase the depth of anesthesia. The patient's heart rate, and blood pressure stabilized, but the patient started desaturating with apneic spells, so we decided to abandon the procedure. The patient was allowed to wake up. Regional anesthesia was taken as the next option. Even after three attempts by expert hands no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained through the spinal needle.
Taylor's approach was attempted. Clear CSF was obtained through the spinal needle and 3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine and 25μg/kg fentanyl was injected intrathecally. Due to the spinal deformity, we were not able to achieve the appropriate position for intrathecal block. Therefore, we carried out some maneuvres; we placed a pillow beneath the left shoulder to make the spine of the scapula perpendicular to the table, and the operating table (OT) was tilted 20° to the right, to straighten the spine and to make it parallel to the floor.
The block was adequate with sensory block up to T4 and adequate motor blockade upto T6. The vital signs remained stable. Fluid calculations and management of blood pressure were very important in this patient with severe lung disease. Prone position had to be given carefully, with bolsters confirming to the contours of the patient, to avoid fractures.
There were no intraoperative problems throughout the procedure, which was completed within three hours. Hemostasis was adequate. Supplementary oxygen was administered continuously during the surgical procedure. There were no postoperative sequelae to the spinal technique.","Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?

He had a good performance status (grade 0). Laboratory tests showed serum albumin level of 5.3 g/dL, bilirubin level of 1.3 mg/dL, and prothrombin time international normalized ratio of 1.1. Neither ascites nor hepatic encephalopathy was found, which corresponded with Child-Pugh class A. Serologic markers for hepatitis B and C were negative. Serum α-fetoprotein level was 311.7 ng/mL, and PIVKA-II level was over 2,000 mAU/mL. Other laboratory findings including tumor markers and thyroid function tests were within normal limits. About a 5 cm sized ovoid enhancing mass in arterial phase involving the caudate lobe with underlying cirrhotic configuration of the liver was shown on the dynamic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (, respectively). There was no vascular invasion and no intraabdominal lymphadenopathy. On positron emission tomography-CT, maximum standardized uptake value for the mass was 6.3 without evidence of distant metastasis. Overall, early stage of HCC was assigned according to the Barcelona-Clinic-Liver-Cancer (BCLC) HCC staging system.
Surgical resection was recommended for the treatment of the HCC, however, he refused the surgical treatment. TACE using DEB was performed after obtaining written informed consent for the procedure. During the first TACE session, hepatic angiogram revealed a definite hypervascular mass supplied by a small branch of the left hepatic artery without apparent arteriovenous shunt (). After positioning the microcatheter tip at the left hepatic artery close to the tumor-feeding branch, a mixture of DEB (DC Bead®, 1 vial of 300~500 µm diameter, Biocompatibles, UK) loaded with doxorubicin (50 mg) and contrast agent was infused until the flow through the tumor-feeding artery was slowed down. After the infusion, angiogram showed occluded tumor-feeding branch and no tumor staining ().
He had no serious adverse event after embolization except mild abdominal pain that was controlled with oral analgesic (tramadol 50 mg per os tid). One-month post-embolization CT () and six-month post-embolization MRI () showed complete necrosis without viable portions.

202,15,Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality,severity,integer,pmc-3712811-1,Extracted,"A 70-year-old Mongolian man was referred to our hospital suffering from high-grade fever and chills. He had a past medical history of esophageal varices rupture 20 years before. Since then, he had visited our hospital for alcoholic liver cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus. He received a treatment for ascites caused by liver cirrhosis. Urinary diuresis was not effective because of low Na level and dehydration. As liver function was relatively suppressed, he underwent Denver shunt implantation 9 months before presentation. After the operation of Denver shunt implantation, ascites rapidly disappeared. Diabetes mellitus was controlled well (HbA1c 6.3%) by a oral hypoglycemic agent (glimepiride 3 mg/day).
This time, he developed high-grade fever with chills and without gastrointestinal symptoms. His body temperature was 38.5°C, but he was hemodynamically stable with normal mental status. Initial laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell count 7,700/μl, hemoglobin 12.9 g/dl, platelets 5.6 × 104/μl PT-INR 1.43, CRP 5.0 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 349 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 353 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 522 IU/l, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 104 IU/l, total bilirubin (T-bil) 4.3 mg/dl and albumin 4.1 g/dl. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) showed multiple small low-echoic lesions in the right lobe of the liver (fig. ). These findings were further confirmed by abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) that showed peripheral enhancement with central hypodense multiple small lesions in the right lobe of the liver with no ascites (fig. ). After admission to our hospital, he underwent echocardiography, chest CT, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy, however, no other sources of infection could be detected. Blood culture was negative and anti-amebic antibody was also negative. He was treated for pyogenic liver abscesses with sulbactam/cefoperazone for 2 weeks and subsequently changed to levofloxacin for 2 months. The liver abscesses disappeared after the antibiotic treatment and liver function normalized to original levels (AST 44 IU/l, ALT 37 IU/l, ALP 336 IU/l, GGT 85 IU/l and T-bil 0.9 mg/dl). However, 3 months later, he suffered from high-grade fever with chills and no other symptoms. Laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell count 7,400/μl, platelets 4.6 × 104/μl, CRP 9.2 mg/dl, AST 933 IU/l, ALT 1,202 IU/l, ALP 870 IU/l, GGT 93 IU/l and T-bil 4.0 mg/dl. Abdominal enhanced CT showed multiple small lesions in both lobes of the liver (fig. 2). Blood culture was negative. Sulbactam/cefoperazone had no effects. Meropenem was administered for 2 weeks, followed by levofloxacin for 2 months, and liver function rapidly normalized to original levels (AST 43 IU/l, ALT 30 IU/l, ALP 435 IU/l, GGT 87 IU/l and T-bil 1.8 mg/dl). After the levofloxacin treatment, the disappearance of liver abscess was confirmed (fig. ). We started selective intestinal decontamination by administering kanamycin (2 g/day) to prevent the occurrence of abdominal infection. Since then, he has had no recurrence of liver abscess for over a year.

209,15,Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality,severity,integer,pmc-4236611-1,Extracted,"A 41-year-old man was initially evaluated in the emergency department for a 2-month history of shortness of breath, abdominal distension, scrotal swelling, and left inguinal pain. Past history included long-term use of intravenous drugs, extensive and current alcohol use with evidence of cirrhosis based on laboratory findings, and imaging and seropositivity for hepatitis C antibody without measurable viremia. He also had a history of sustaining an upper abdominal stab wound requiring exploratory laparotomy in the early 1990s. He denied fevers, rigors, night sweats, weight loss, or skin rashes.
Initial evaluation revealed an ill appearing man with tachycardia (heart rate 120 beats/min) with mild hypotension (blood pressure 85–105/50–60 mmHg), and tachypnea (respiratory rate 20–25/min) requiring 2 L/min supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain a blood oxygen saturation >95 %. He had distant heart sounds with tachycardia and regular rhythm without murmurs or gallops. He had jugular venous distension with a positive Kussmaul’s sign and pulsus paradoxus. There was significant abdominal distention present with a fluid wave. He had stigmata of chronic liver disease with spider angiomata noted and collateral venous distension in the abdominal wall. Furthermore, he had scrotal swelling and bilateral lower extremity edema. He was admitted to the hospital’s Medicine Service.
On admission, a chest radiograph revealed enlargement of the cardiac silhouette (Fig. ). A bedside echocardiogram illustrated a large pericardial effusion with evidence of hemodynamic compromise, including right atrial and right ventricular diastolic collapse, a >30 % respiratory variability in the tricuspid and mitral valve flow rates, and a swinging cardiac motion consistent with the presence of cardiac tamponade demanding urgent intervention.
Admission laboratory values revealed a normal white blood cell count, a mild macrocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume 95 fL) with a hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, a hematocrit of 36 %, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 84,000/μL. Tests of liver function revealed serum concentrations of albumin of 2.2 g/dL (N > 3.5 g/dL), total bilirubin of 3.1 mg/dL, with direct bilirubin of 1.9 mg/dL, an aspartate aminotransferase of 83 U/mL, an alanine aminotransferase of 37 U/mL, an alkaline phosphatase of 106 U/mL (upper limits of normal 150 U/mL), and a γ-glutamyl transpeptidase of 48 U/mL (upper limits of normal <98 U/L). Studies of coagulation revealed an elevated prothrombin time (PT) of 21 s and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.87. Abdominal paracentesis revealed a serum albumin-to-ascites gradient (SAAG) >1.1 g/dL, and a total protein concentration of <2.5 g/dL, consistent with portal hypertension: The total white blood cell count was 220/mm3, with 22 % neutrophils. These results were compatible with the diagnosis of an uninfected ascites due to portal hypertension as a probable consequence of his cirrhosis. The initial chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly, bilateral pulmonary edema, and minimal pleural effusions (Fig. ). Ultrasound scan of the right upper quadrant revealed a nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension such as mild splenomegaly and large volume ascites with no space-occupying lesion was identified. Admission pericardiocentesis had an opening pressure of 20 mmHg and, after removal of 1.5 L of serous pericardial fluid and placement of a drain, a closing pressure of 9 mmHg. Pericardial fluid analysis revealed protein concentrations and other characteristics identical to those found in the ascitic fluid: All pericardial cultures were negative, and no organisms were seen. Otherwise, the echocardiogram was relatively normal, as was cardiac function. Over the succeeding 24 h, 3 L of fluid drained from the pericardial sac, as did an additional 3 L during the subsequent 24-h period. It was suspected that ascitic fluid was exiting through the pericardial drain.
During investigation, a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 28 mm/h and serum concentrations of C-reactive protein of 1.1 mg/dL, creatine phosphokinase of 101 U/L, aldolase of 6.1 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase of 398 U/L were all noted. Serum lipids and triglycerides were unremarkable. Investigation for the etiology of chronic liver disease revealed a serum ferritin of 113 ng/mL, negative anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies, and negative virologic evidence for hepatitis A or B. Hepatitis C Ab was positive, but serum hepatitis C virus was undetectable. Serum α-1 anti-trypsin and ceruloplasmin, serum copper, and TSH concentrations were normal. Serological investigations for a possible rheumatological disease were unremarkable as well as infectious evaluation for HIV, Lyme disease, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A PET/CT scan revealed no FDG-avid focus in any area.
Since decreased pericardial fluid volume was noted on the fourth and fifth hospital days, the pericardial drain was removed. Two days later, he became progressively dyspneic with repeat chest X-ray showing bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly, and diffuses pulmonary edema.
A radionuclide SPECT scan was then performed following injection of 5.11 mCi 99mTechnetium-labeled, macroaggregated albumin (MAA) into the peritoneal cavity. There was essentially no delay between the infusion of 99mTc-MAA and imaging. Although dynamic imaging was performed, the uptake in the pericardial sac was only faint at 15 min, but clearly visible at 1 h. The most impressive images were obtained at 4–24 h (Fig. ), where there was circumferential pericardial radiotracer distribution.",What is the patient's Child-Pugh Score?

The Child-Pugh Score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.

The current child pugh score is 0.
The patient's INR is 1.87. Because the INR is between 1.7 and 2.3, we add two to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.
The concentration of bilirubin is 3.1 mg/dL. Because the bilirubin concentration is greater than 3 mg/dL, we add 3 to the score, making the current total 2 + 3 = 5.
The concentration of albumin is 2.2 g/dL. Because the albumin concentration is less than 2.8 g/dL, we add 3 points to the score, making the current total 5 + 3 = 8.
The patient's ascites state is determined to be 'moderate' and so we add 3 points to the score, making the current total 8 + 3 = 11.
The patient is determined to not have any encephalopathy and so we add one point to the score, making the current total 11 + 1 = 12.
The patient's child pugh score is 12."
236,16,Wells' Criteria for DVT,risk,decimal,15,Synthetic,"A 47-year-old man with a history limited to well-controlled mild asthma and seasonal rhinitis presented to the ambulatory triage area mid-morning complaining of an aching sensation and progressive enlargement of his right calf that began roughly thirty-hours prior while he was at work installing cabinetry in a two-story townhome. He recalls kneeling frequently and carrying heavy toolboxes up a flight of stairs but denies any single twisting injury, audible pop, or sharp pain; instead, he noticed a vague tightness behind the knee late that evening which intensified overnight, prompting him to inspect both lower limbs side-by-side in the bathroom mirror. The following morning his work sock left a noticeable indentation at the upper ankle and the posterior calf looked fuller than its counterpart, so he measured the circumference with a flexible sewing tape he keeps for home projects: at a point exactly 10 cm distal to the tibial tuberosity the right leg measured 41 cm whereas the left measured 37 cm, a disparity of 4 cm that persisted when rechecked two hours later before clinic arrival. He reports no comparable swelling of the thigh, knee, or foot, no discoloration, and no warmth appreciable through his trouser leg. He has not been bedridden—he walks his dog twice daily, drove himself to the clinic, and continues normal activities except for avoiding squats because they provoke discomfort. He has not undergone surgery, endoscopy, or invasive dental work in the past year, and the most recent hospitalization was an overnight observation for an asthma exacerbation four years ago. He has never received chemotherapy, has no known malignancy, and has not required a cast, splint, or immobilizing boot. He flew to Denver on a two-hour flight last week but sat in an aisle seat and walked the terminal without prolonged stasis. He denies fever, chills, sweats, rash, trauma, insect bite, recent soft-tissue infection, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, hemoptysis, or syncope. Medications include inhaled budesonide-formoterol twice daily and an albuterol rescue inhaler used perhaps once a month; he takes no hormonal preparations, anticoagulants, or herbal supplements. He never smokes, drinks two beers on weekends, and does not use illicit drugs. There is no family history of thromboembolic disease or hypercoagulable states. On examination he appears fit, ambulating with a slight antalgic gait favoring the right side but otherwise in no distress. Vital signs: temperature 98.4 °F (36.9 °C), pulse 88 beats/min regular, blood pressure 128/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 14/min, and oxygen saturation 98 % on ambient air. Cardiac auscultation reveals a normal S1/S2 without murmurs; lungs are clear with no wheezes; jugular venous pressure is not elevated. Abdomen is soft and nontender. Inspection of the lower extremities shows asymmetric fullness confined to the mid-calf region of the right leg with a subtle glossy sheen of overlying skin; the right ankle and foot appear normal in size, and thigh girth measured 15 cm proximal to the patella is symmetric at 50 cm bilaterally. Gentle finger pressure over the anterior tibia of the right calf produces a 2-mm pit that rebounds within 15 seconds, whereas no indentation forms on the left. The right calf feels slightly warmer but not erythematous. Palpation along the course of the popliteal and posterior tibial venous channels elicits focal tenderness deep to the medial gastrocnemius; squeezing the muscle belly itself produces only diffuse soreness. There is no palpable cord, no varicosities, and no cyanosis of the toes. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are 2+ and equal; capillary refill is less than two seconds. Range of motion at the knee and ankle is full; dorsiflexion of the ankle with knee extended reproduces a pulling discomfort but no lancinating pain. Neurologic examination shows intact sensation and 5/5 motor strength. No inguinal lymphadenopathy is present. Bedside urine dip is unremarkable. Baseline laboratory tests obtained before any anticoagulant therapy demonstrate hemoglobin 15.0 g/dL, platelet count 242 × 10⁹/L, white blood cell count 7.1 × 10⁹/L, serum creatinine 0.92 mg/dL, sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.0 mmol/L, AST/ALT within normal limits, prothrombin time 12.1 seconds with an INR of 1.0, and aPTT 29 seconds. An electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm. Clinically, the unilateral calf enlargement greater than 3 cm, discrete pitting edema confined to the symptomatic limb, and pinpoint tenderness tracking the deep venous pathway raise strong concern for an obstructive process within the deep veins of the right calf; musculoskeletal strain or ruptured popliteal cyst remain possibilities but appear less compelling given the objective girth discrepancy and focal venous tenderness. Duplex ultrasonography of the entire right lower extremity has been ordered on an urgent basis, and the patient has been instructed to limit strenuous activity and to alert staff immediately should he notice sudden chest discomfort or worsening shortness of breath while awaiting imaging.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis?

230,16,Wells' Criteria for DVT,risk,decimal,10,Synthetic,"A 49-year-old woman came to the urgent care area of the medical ward late this morning because of new-onset pain and fullness in her right upper calf that started while she was grocery shopping yesterday afternoon. She describes the discomfort as a deep, pressure-like ache that intensifies when she flexes the knee or when the examiner presses along the line from the medial calf toward the popliteal fossa; she can localize it with one finger and says it is clearly worse when weight-bearing. She denies redness, warmth, itching, fever, chills, or recent skin trauma. She had been back at work as a high-school principal for the last three weeks after undergoing an open sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis for complicated diverticulitis exactly six weeks ago; the postoperative course was uneventful, she was walking the hallways on postoperative day one, and she never required prolonged bed rest at home. Her medical history is notable for a documented iliofemoral venous thrombosis on the opposite side five years earlier that was confirmed by duplex ultrasound and treated with a six-month course of warfarin until complete recanalization was demonstrated. She has no history of malignancy, chronic neurologic deficits, lower-limb casting, pelvic fractures, or recent air travel, and she has remained physically active, walking two miles most evenings with her spouse. Medications include a daily multivitamin, rosuvastatin 10 mg, and ibuprofen as needed for postoperative abdominal wall soreness; she is not taking estrogen-containing therapy, glucocorticoids, or anticoagulants. She quit smoking 10 years ago after a 12-pack-year history and drinks wine on weekends; there is no family history of inherited clotting disorders, premature myocardial infarction, or malignancy. Review of systems is otherwise negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, hemoptysis, abdominal pain, or unexplained weight loss. On arrival her vital signs were temperature 37.0 °C, blood pressure 124/76 mm Hg, heart rate 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99 % breathing room air. She appeared well and was able to stand on the examination stool without assistance. Cardiac auscultation revealed a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs; lungs were clear to bases without crackles. The abdominal incision was healed with no tenderness or mass. Examination of the lower limbs showed the right calf to be slightly fuller to the eye but without taut skin or discoloration; when measured 10 cm below the tibial tuberosity the circumference was 38.5 cm versus 37.2 cm on the left, a discrepancy she said she had not noticed before. Gentle compression over the course of the posterior tibial and popliteal veins elicited focal tenderness, whereas squeezing the gastrocnemius muscle belly away from those structures was much less uncomfortable. The overlying skin was warm but dry, and no indentation was produced after five seconds of firm thumb pressure over the tibia. A network of bluish, non-tortuous superficial channels was visibly prominent along the medial aspect of the calf and became more obvious when the leg was placed in a dependent position for several seconds. There were no spider angiomas, no stasis dermatitis, and no varicosities elsewhere. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were 2+ bilaterally and symmetric; capillary refill was brisk, and sensorimotor testing of both lower extremities was normal. There was no inguinal lymphadenopathy, hip tenderness, or back pain. Point-of-care laboratory testing obtained prior to any treatment showed hemoglobin 13.4 g/dL, platelet count 212 × 10⁹/L, serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, and INR 1.0. Electrocardiogram displayed normal sinus rhythm without acute changes. No obvious musculoskeletal or infectious etiology was identified on history or examination, and the examiner judged that other causes of unilateral calf pain—such as cellulitis, muscular strain, Baker cyst rupture, or arterial insufficiency—were less consistent with the physical findings than an occlusion in the deep venous system. She was counseled about signs of pulmonary embolism and remained in the department awaiting formal duplex ultrasonography to confirm the suspected diagnosis.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis?

235,16,Wells' Criteria for DVT,risk,decimal,14,Synthetic,"A 38-year-old postpartum woman arrived to the ambulatory triage area late this afternoon because her left lower leg had become noticeably heavier and mildly painful over the preceding 24 hours. Six weeks ago she delivered her second child via uncomplicated scheduled cesarean section that required spinal anesthesia and an overnight stay; she was discharged on postoperative day 2 and has since resumed routine household activities without assistive devices. Yesterday morning, while standing at the kitchen counter for an extended period preparing bottles, she felt a dull pressure deep in the posterior aspect of the calf that worsened when she bore weight and eased modestly with elevation. By evening she observed that her sock left an imprint on that side but not on the right. She denies antecedent trauma, ankle sprain, insect bite, recent intense exercise, or local skin infection. She also denies fevers, chills, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, or constitutional complaints. There is no history of malignant disease, hematologic disorder, or prior venous clot, nor has she ever required anticoagulation. She reports no neurologic illness, limb weakness, or application of a plaster cast, and she has remained fully mobile caring for her newborn. She uses no estrogen-containing contraception and takes only prenatal vitamins and 600 mg ibuprofen as needed for incisional soreness. Both parents are alive and free of venous thromboembolic events; no siblings have clotting disorders. She has never smoked, drinks wine rarely, and denies illicit drug use. On presentation she appeared comfortable holding the infant carrier, spoke in complete sentences, and ambulated without assistance. Vital signs before any medications were temperature 37.0 °C, blood pressure 118/72 mm Hg, heart rate 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99 % on ambient air. Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rhythm with no murmurs; lungs were clear to auscultation. Abdominal inspection showed a well-healed Pfannenstiel scar that was nontender with no palpable masses or organomegaly. Inspection of the lower extremities demonstrated subtle fullness confined to the left calf; there was no erythema, hyperpigmentation, varicosity, or brawny skin change. A flexible tape placed 10 cm below the tibial tuberosity measured 38.0 cm on the left and 36.4 cm on the right, a disparity of 1.6 cm. Circumference at mid-thigh and around the ankle was symmetric. Gentle thumb pressure over the anterior tibia and dorsum of the left foot produced a 1+ indentation that resolved within 15 seconds, whereas identical pressure on the right left no depression. Palpation along the course of the popliteal vein and posteromedial calf elicited focal discomfort described by the patient as “a deep bruise,” compared with no tenderness over the contralateral limb; squeezing the gastrocnemius muscle belly away from the neurovascular bundle produced only minimal diffuse soreness. There was no palpable subcutaneous cord and no crepitus. Passive dorsiflexion of the ankle did not reproduce pain at the Achilles insertion. Skin temperature was marginally warmer over the symptomatic calf compared with the right when assessed with the dorsum of the examiner’s hand. Distal pulses—dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial—were 2+ bilaterally, and capillary refill of all toes was under two seconds. Motor strength in ankle dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, and great-toe extension was 5/5, and sensation to light touch and vibration was intact. Straight-leg raise and seated slump test were negative for radicular symptoms, making a spinal etiology improbable. There was no ipsilateral knee effusion, meniscal tenderness, or ligamentous laxity, and range of motion at the hip, knee, and ankle was full. No inguinal lymphadenopathy was appreciated. Basic laboratory studies obtained prior to any antithrombotic therapy showed hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL, platelet count 248 × 10⁹/L, white blood cells 7.1 × 10⁹/L, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, and an INR of 1.0 with activated partial thromboplastin time 29 seconds. These values reveal no anemia, thrombocytopenia, or renal impairment that might confound subsequent management. Given the recent abdominal-pelvic surgical intervention within the past two months, the presence of unilateral pitting edema confined to the calf, focal tenderness along the deep venous pathway, and the absence of a compelling musculoskeletal, dermatologic, or neurologic explanation, an acute thrombotic obstruction of the deep venous system remains the leading consideration at this stage of evaluation.",What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis?

248,17,Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk,risk,integer,3,Synthetic,"A 67-year-old woman presented to the pre-operative assessment clinic the afternoon before a scheduled open repair of a 6.1 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, an operation classified by the surgical team as a major vascular intervention given the anticipated cross-clamp time and retroperitoneal exposure. She was referred for medical clearance by her vascular surgeon after routine laboratory studies and chart review raised concern for possible peri-operative cardiac and renal risk. The patient ambulated into the office without dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal breathing disturbance, or peripheral edema, and she denied any history of nocturnal cough, frothy sputum, weight gain from fluid, or lower-extremity swelling. Her exercise tolerance was described as walking six city blocks at a moderate pace and climbing a single flight of household stairs while carrying groceries, limited more by occasional lumbar discomfort than by chest pressure or shortness of breath. She explicitly denied prior episodes of angina, myocardial infarction, coronary stenting, coronary artery bypass, or positive stress imaging. Review of vascular history, however, was notable for a lacunar infarct in the left corona radiata 4 years earlier, which had manifested with transient right-arm numbness and dysarthria that resolved fully within 48 hours following intravenous thrombolysis. Subsequent neurologic follow-up confirmed no residual weakness or speech deficit, and she remains on daily aspirin and a high-intensity statin for secondary prevention; she reports strict adherence and no bleeding complications. Her other chronic illnesses include well-controlled essential hypertension managed with losartan 100 mg each morning, stage 3 chronic kidney disease attributed to hypertensive nephrosclerosis with baseline creatinine values fluctuating between 1.8 and 2.1 mg/dL, and mixed dyslipidemia. She has never been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and therefore has never required insulin or other glucose-lowering agents; her most recent fasting plasma glucose six months ago was 93 mg/dL and hemoglobin A1c was 5.6%. There is no personal or family history of congestive cardiomyopathy, rheumatic valvular disease, or congenital heart anomalies. She quit smoking 12 years ago after a 30-pack-year career and denies alcohol use or illicit substances. Medications taken on the morning of evaluation include losartan, amlodipine 5 mg, aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg nightly, and cholecalciferol. On physical examination in the pre-operative suite she appeared comfortable and conversant, blood pressure was 138/72 mm Hg in the right arm seated, heart rate 74 beats per minute and regular, respiratory rate 14, oxygen saturation 98% on ambient air, oral temperature 36.8 °C, and body mass index 28.4 kg/m². Jugular venous pulsation was not elevated, carotid upstrokes were brisk without bruit, and auscultation revealed a normal S1 and S2 with no gallops, murmurs, or rubs. Lungs were clear to the bases, abdomen soft with a palpable pulsatile mass consistent with the known aneurysm but no tenderness, and peripheral pulses were 2+ bilaterally with warm extremities and intact neurologic function. Pre-operative laboratory panel drawn two hours earlier showed stable anemia with hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, platelets 235 ×10⁹/L, sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.3 mmol/L, bicarbonate 23 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 41 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 2.3 mg/dL, representing a slight rise from her last nephrology clinic visit but without accompanying oliguria or uremic symptoms. Electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria, and no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. A transthoracic echocardiogram from eight months prior documented normal left ventricular size, concentric hypertrophy, and an ejection fraction of 60% without regional wall motion abnormality, valvular stenosis, or regurgitation. The patient expresses understanding of the need for the upcoming complex intra-abdominal operation to prevent aneurysmal rupture and is eager to proceed, requesting guidance on peri-operative cardiac surveillance and renal protection. After discussion of her stroke history, renal function, blood pressure control, and overall functional capacity, she agreed to continue her antihypertensives up to the morning of surgery, withhold the aspirin as directed by the vascular team, and undergo intra-operative arterial line placement for beat-to-beat monitoring.",What is the patient's score of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk?

259,17,Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk,risk,integer,9,Synthetic,"A 78-year-old man was evaluated this afternoon in the peri-operative medicine clinic at the request of the orthopedic team in anticipation of next week’s elective right total knee arthroplasty for end-stage tricompartmental osteoarthritis causing severe mechanical pain and limitation of ambulation; the procedure is planned under regional anesthesia with a projected operative time of 90 minutes and an overnight hospital stay. He reports that over the past several years the gradual deterioration of his knee has obliged him to use a single-point cane for outdoor walking, and his activity tolerance is roughly two level city blocks at a slow pace before he must pause because of joint discomfort rather than breathlessness or chest pressure. Eight months ago he required admission for worsening lower-extremity swelling and exertional dyspnea that responded to intravenous loop diuretics, and a transthoracic echocardiogram obtained during that hospitalization showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 % with mild global hypokinesis; since discharge he has remained clinically compensated on carvedilol 12.5 mg twice daily, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, and torsemide 20 mg each morning, with no further episodes of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or unplanned clinic visits. For secondary stroke prevention, he takes aspirin 81 mg daily and high-intensity atorvastatin after suffering a small left thalamic infarct three years prior that initially produced transient gait ataxia; he completed outpatient physical therapy, denies any residual focal weakness, and has experienced no recurrent neurologic symptoms such as acute visual changes, speech disturbance, or unilateral numbness. Other long-standing conditions include well-controlled hypertension, stage 3 chronic kidney disease attributed to long-standing vascular disease and prior exposure to intravenous contrast, and hyperlipidemia; he has never been told he has diabetes mellitus and his last fasting plasma glucose six months ago was 101 mg/dL. He quit smoking more than two decades ago after a 25-pack-year history, drinks a glass of red wine with dinner most evenings, and denies illicit drug use. Current home medications also comprise amlodipine 5 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg each morning, vitamin D supplementation, and as-needed acetaminophen for knee pain; no drug allergies are reported. Family history is notable for a brother with heart failure and a mother who sustained a cerebrovascular accident in her 70s; there is no early coronary disease in first-degree relatives. On examination today he appeared comfortable seated in the clinic chair, conversant, and euvolemic. Vital signs: blood pressure 126/68 mm Hg in the right arm seated, heart rate 68 beats per minute and regular, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 97 % on ambient air, oral temperature 36.7 °C, and body mass index 29 kg/m². Neck veins were not distended at 45°, carotid upstrokes were brisk without bruit, and the precordial exam revealed a displaced apical impulse and a soft third heart sound without murmurs or pericardial rub. Lung fields were clear to auscultation with no crackles or wheezes, abdomen was soft and non-tender without organomegaly, and 1+ bilateral ankle pitting edema was present. Neurologic assessment demonstrated intact cranial nerves, full strength, normal coordination, and steady gait with a cane. Pre-operative laboratory studies drawn this morning revealed hemoglobin 12.2 g/dL, hematocrit 36 %, white blood cell count 7.4 × 10⁹/L, platelet count 215 × 10⁹/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 34 mg/dL, and a serum creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, which is consistent with his baseline values over the past year; estimated glomerular filtration rate by CKD-EPI equation calculates to 48 mL/min/1.73 m². Random glucose in clinic measured 104 mg/dL. Electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria and no acute ST-T changes. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram performed six weeks ago at his cardiology follow-up confirmed the prior ejection fraction with stable dimensions, mild concentric hypertrophy, trace mitral regurgitation, and normal right ventricular function. Chest radiograph obtained today shows a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette without pulmonary venous congestion or interstitial edema. He describes adherence to a low-sodium diet, weighs himself daily, and has not required an increase in diuretic dosing for the past four months. Functional capacity on the Duke Activity Status Index questionnaire corresponds to approximately 4 metabolic equivalents, limited primarily by knee pain. The anesthesia service has assessed his airway as Mallampati class II with intact dentition and normal cervical spine mobility; spinal anesthesia with femoral nerve block is favored, and an arterial line is not anticipated. The orthopedic surgeon has requested that beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy be continued through the morning of surgery, whereas the diuretic will be held the day of operation to reduce the risk of intravascular depletion; aspirin will be stopped five days prior per regional anesthesia protocol, and atorvastatin will be continued. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis will consist of mechanical compression intra-operatively followed by low-dose subcutaneous anticoagulation post-operatively once hemostasis is assured. The patient verbalizes clear understanding of the surgical plan, anticipated recovery course, potential cardiac and neurologic risks, and strategies to mitigate postoperative fluid shifts, and he remains eager to proceed in hopes of regaining the ability to walk without assistive devices.",What is the patient's score of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk?

249,17,Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk,risk,integer,4,Synthetic,"A 62-year-old woman presented to the pre-operative medicine clinic three weeks before a scheduled elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. She had been referred by her general surgeon for a comprehensive assessment to optimize medical conditions prior to anesthesia. The patient reported that the biliary colic began approximately eight months earlier and had grown progressively more frequent, prompting the decision for surgery; the operation is planned as a minimally invasive abdominal procedure expected to last under two hours and is not considered particularly hazardous from a cardiovascular standpoint. Past medical history is notable for long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus first diagnosed at age 38. Glycemic control at home relies on a multiple daily injection regimen consisting of basal glargine each night and rapid-acting insulin lispro before meals; she meticulously records glucose values, with most recent self-monitoring logs showing fasting readings in the 110–140 mg/dL range. There is also well-controlled essential hypertension treated with lisinopril 20 mg daily and low-dose hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg each morning. She has hyperlipidemia managed with atorvastatin 40 mg nightly, with a last LDL of 82 mg/dL six months ago. She denies ever experiencing angina, exertional chest tightness, radiation of discomfort to the arm or jaw, or rest pain. She has never been hospitalized for heart-related shortness of breath, fluid overload, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower-extremity edema and has never required diuretics beyond those for blood pressure control. There is no personal history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, carotid artery surgery, or focal neurologic deficits. She has never undergone percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass, or peripheral vascular revascularization. Her exercise tolerance is reasonably good; she walks her dog briskly for 30 minutes daily, climbs two flights of stairs without pausing, and gardens without symptoms. She has no chronic lung disease, takes no inhalers, and has never smoked. Family history reveals a father with myocardial infarction at 72 and a mother with type 2 diabetes; no premature cardiac or cerebrovascular events are reported. She consumes a glass of wine with dinner on weekends and denies illicit drug use. Allergies include a pruritic rash with sulfa antibiotics. Review of systems is negative for palpitations, syncope, orthopnea, nocturnal cough, claudication, or visual disturbances. On examination, she appears well and in no distress, body mass index 31 kg/m². Blood pressure is 132/78 mm Hg in the right arm, heart rate 78 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate 14 breaths/min, temperature 36.8 °C, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Jugular venous pressure is not elevated; carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits. Cardiac auscultation reveals a normal S1 and S2 with no gallops, murmurs, or rubs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft with mild right upper quadrant tenderness but no guarding or rebound. Extremities show no peripheral edema, pulses are 2+ and symmetric. Neurologic examination demonstrates full strength, intact sensation, and normal gait. Laboratory studies obtained the same morning include a basic metabolic panel demonstrating serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 14 mg/dL, sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.3 mmol/L, chloride 102 mmol/L, bicarbonate 26 mmol/L, and glucose 172 mg/dL. Complete blood count is unremarkable with hemoglobin 13.1 g/dL, hematocrit 39.4%, platelets 256 × 10⁹/L, and white blood cell count 6.3 × 10⁹/L. Liver function tests show AST 34 U/L, ALT 30 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 122 U/L, and total bilirubin 1.3 mg/dL. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein and thyroid-stimulating hormone are within reference ranges. Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm at 76 beats/min with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities and a corrected QT of 420 ms. A resting two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram performed by her primary cardiologist two months earlier for a new-patient evaluation demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, normal chamber sizes, and no valvular stenosis or regurgitation of more than mild degree. She is currently taking lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, atorvastatin, and her insulin injections; no beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or antiplatelet agents are prescribed. She fasted overnight before laboratory testing and has not yet begun any peri-operative antibiotics or anticoagulants. The anesthesiology service has reviewed her airway and anticipates no difficulty with intubation. She has been counseled on continuing her usual evening basal insulin with a modest dose reduction the night before surgery and holding rapid-acting insulin on the morning of the procedure while checking point-of-care glucose on arrival to the pre-operative holding area. Updated vaccinations, including influenza and pneumococcal, are current.

264,18,HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events,risk,integer,pmc-7453687-1,Extracted,"A 51- year old male, with no prior medical history, no medication, non-smoker and without risk factors for venous thrombo-embolism arrived at the end of April to the emergency department with exercise induced dyspnea during 4–5 weeks and for the last 48 h dyspnea also at rest. Prior to the onset of symptoms, he had lived socially isolated with his wife from mid-March, approximately 40 days, both working from home and with their two children home from school. He described a short period in the beginning of March, 7 weeks before hospitalization, when he felt difficulties taking deep breaths for a couple of days but no other symptoms like cough, fever or feeling of malaise. Following that episode he experienced a gradually increased fatigue on his regular run and in the beginning of April he had to start walking when running uphill. During the last 5 weeks before hospitalization his wife and daughter had noticed signs of heavy breathing when he walked up the stairs.
Physical examination was normal, examination of the heart and lungs revealed no discrepancies, no swollen legs or other signs of cardiac decompensation. The bodyweight of the patient was 90 kg and his height was 1.88 m, body mass index (BMI) was 25,5 kg/m2. He had normal temperature and a regular heart rate of 80 beats/min. He had a blood pressure of 180/65 mmHg and an oxygen saturation of 93% breathing ambient air. High sensitivity Troponin T was markedly elevated, 1200 (reference < 15 mg/L) and also B-type natriuretic peptide was increased, 737 (reference < 125 ng/L). He had a slightly increased C-reactive protein of 15 (reference < 5 mg/L) and modest leukocytosis 11,7 (normal range 3,5–8,8 × 109/L). ECG showed incomplete right-sided branch block. Computerized Tomography Angiography (CTA) of the chest was performed as pulmonary embolism was suspected. The CTA revealed widespread bilateral segmental pulmonary embolism (Fig. ) and an additional area of consolidation in the right upper lobe consistent with infarction. Additional findings of ground glass opacities that could match Covid-19 were also found (Fig. ). The patient tested negative for SARS -CoV-2 (polymerase chain reaction SARS -CoV-2, GeneXpert, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, United States) at two consecutive nasopharynx tests. No antibody test was performed. The patient was given oxygen and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LWMH), tinzaparin 18,000 units daily during 2 days of hospitalization and was discharged with apixaban 5 mg, twice daily, with a treatment recommendation for 6 months.
Echocardiography revealed dilated right chamber, midventricular diameter of 5 cm and left septum deviation, light to moderate insufficiency of the tricuspid valve with a velocity max of 4,2 m/s. Vena cava inferior showed normal width and breathing variation. Severe pulmonary hypertension with a systolic pulmonary pressure of approximately 75–80 mmHg (normal upper limit 35 mmHg) was present.

271,18,HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events,risk,integer,pmc-4857828-1,Extracted,"A 60-year-old female with past medical history significant for hypertension, DM, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency room with the chief complaint of chest pain. She also reported generalized weakness, myalgias, subjective fever, and chills progressively worsening over the past 7 days. Her physical examination showed stable vital signs and was otherwise unremarkable except for trace peripheral edema. The University of Florida does not require IRB approval or written informed consent for any case report with 3 or fewer patients as it is not a clinical study. 
Fearing a coronary event, she was given a dose of sublingual nitroglycerine and aspirin. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, but otherwise no apparent abnormality. Laboratory workup was significant for elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) of 13,456 U/L (reference range: 30–170 U/L), normal troponin-T, normal complete blood count, and basic metabolic panel except elevated creatinine of 1.20 mg/dL (reference range: 0.40–0.90 mg/dL). Her chest X-ray revealed no abnormality. CPK levels evaluated in 2012 on this patient while on statins were unremarkable (191 U/L, 165 U/L, and 197 U/L, with reference range of 30–170 U/L). 
She was admitted to the hospital due to concern for acute coronary event, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal insufficiency, and possible acute viral infection causing her symptoms. Her workup during hospital stay showed three normal serial troponin-T tests, and myocardial perfusion test revealed no abnormality. Her respiratory viral panel and thyroid stimulation hormone level were normal. Her creatinine also normalized with intravenous (IV) fluids. She had persistent elevated CPK levels, which also trended down with IV fluids. 
Common differential diagnoses for her rhabdomyolysis were explored by detailed history and laboratory workup. There was no history of recent trauma, crush injury, prolonged immobilization, recent surgery, seizures, drug abuse, or alcoholism. Her family history was negative for any kind of myopathy or other hereditary or genetic causes that could explain the elevated CPK value. Her laboratory workup, including thyroid function tests, was unremarkable and failed to explain this episode of rhabdomyolysis. She had been on a stable dose of atorvastatin (40 mg) for several years for hyperlipidemia and reported no myalgias, arthralgias, or abnormal CPK levels. Review of her medication list further revealed that she was started on sitagliptin (Januvia® 100 mg) almost a week before this presentation. She also correlated her symptoms with starting of this new medication. Sitagliptin and atorvastatin were stopped; her subsequent CPK value showed a decreasing trend and was recorded at 1,220 U/L on the day of discharge.

He did not have conventional risk factors for premature coronary artery disease. He described the pain radiates to his left arm and occurred in an intermittent fashion not related to exertion; each episode lasts about 2 hours. The pattern of chest pain was atypical. He mentioned sore throat and cold sweating without coughing. In the emergency room, his blood pressure was 120/60 mmHg and heart rate was 115 bpm. Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 94% while breathing ambient air and tympanic temperature was 36.7°C.
Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia, mild ST segment elevation less than 1 mm in lead I and aVL and ST segment depression of about 1 mm in leads III and aVF (, panel A&B). First cardiac hs-TroponinT result was 911 ng/L (cut off <24ng/L). He was admitted with diagnosis of non ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) or myocarditis. Results of 1 hour cardiac Troponin T was 1155 ng/L. Other Baseline laboratory tests were presented in .
Because of symptoms of sore throat, sweating and also elevated CRP, nasopharyngeal sample was taken and sent for SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR. Lung computed tomography scan revealed bilateral ground glass peripheral densities in lower lobes which was compatible with CT findings of COVID-19 (, panel A). Echocardiography showed normal LV size and systolic function with ejection fraction of about 55%. There was neither regional wall motion abnormality nor pericardial effusion. Results of RT-PCR test became positive which was in concert with lung CT scan findings. Lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated.

The patient has a history of decompensated hepatic cirrhosis that started 1 year ago complicated by ascites and a large umbilical hernia. The patient has had multiple paracentesis and had several episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. His medication list included tramadol and propranolol. Upon admission to the emergency department, he was found to be severely malnourished with significant loss of muscle mass, abdominal distention, and the presence of a large, tender, compressible umbilical hernia. Physical exam showed flank dullness, a fluid wave, and shifting dullness. Vital signs were normal, and he did not show signs of asterixis, hepatic encephalopathy, edema, or fluid overload elsewhere. His white blood cell (WBC) count was high at 10,270/µL and hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 32.6%, and a platelet count of 130,000/µL. Further testing showed hyponatremia at 133 mmol/L and a total bilirubin of 1.9 mg/dL. Liver function test revealed an albumin of 2.9 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 149 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 64 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 36 U/L. X-ray confirmed large-volume ascites and the presence of a ventral hernia. Abdominal ultrasound showed cirrhotic liver morphology with large-volume ascites and splenomegaly. Ascitic fluid was yellow, and analysis showed WBC count of 70/µL, but was otherwise unremarkable. After being admitted to the hospital, patient was given furosemide 40 mg tablet daily and spironolactone 100 mg tablet daily. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further management. Surgical consultation was sought, and since the patient was a very high-risk surgical candidate with loss of muscle mass, surgical intervention was not planned. The patient chose supportive care and prophylactic antibiotics based on infectious disease recommendations. An ostomy pouch was placed over the hernia to prevent bacterial contamination and peritonitis as well as to collect the ascitic fluid. The patient’s severe abdominal pain subsided and was discharged to follow up with his primary care physician.
Three months after the patient was discharged, he came back to the hospital with worsening symptoms because he could not afford the ostomy pouches. He was not compliant with his follow-ups. His umbilical hernia appeared to have worsened, and ascitic fluid was leaking out from multiple areas on his hernia, and there were also multiple areas of skin necrosis. Since the patient was deemed a high-risk surgical candidate, he was, again, not cleared for surgery. The patient opted for conservative care and prophylactic antibiotics according to infectious disease suggestions. After symptoms improved, he was instructed on being more compliant and then subsequently discharged.",What is the patient's score of the Fibrosis 4 Index?

A month later, she underwent CP shunt placement for cyst formation after resection. The postoperative course was uneventful and she was well without shunt-related problems for 26 years. She developed a brain abscess related to the shunt catheter at the age of 55. A surgical removal of the catheter was attempted, but was not technically possible, and only the segment from the clavicle to the breast was removed with ligation of the two remaining ends. The two disconnected catheter segments remained in situ and were not retrieved. A year later, she was taken to a local hospital with continuous right-breast pain. The diagnosis of acute mastitis was made and she was referred to our institution for further examination. On presentation, her right breast was swollen with erythema (Fig. ). There was no abdominal pain and change in bowel habits. Funduscopic evaluation was normal with no signs of increased intracranial pressure. Her temperature was 36.7°C, and laboratory tests revealed a decreased platelet count of 103 000/μl, elevated AST of 97 U/l, ALT of 72 U/l and C-reactive protein level of 1.4 mg/dl. The breast abscess was drained under local anesthesia. Cultures taken from the abscess showed enteric organisms including Enterococcus avium, Klebsiella oxytoca and Bacillus. Abdominal CT showed that the shunt catheter was in the splenic flexure of the transverse colon with no other abnormalities (Fig. ). Colonoscopy was performed to survey the colon and the shunt catheter was found inside the lumen at the splenic flexure (Fig. ). Acute mastitis caused by enteric organisms which had migrated through the shunt catheter after penetration into the transverse colon was the presumptive diagnosis, and the catheter removed under general anesthesia.

The medical history of patient revealed that he was diagnosed as a hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier about 20 years earlier, but was lost to follow up. The patient was not a heavy drinker or smoker. There was no significant family history. On physical examination, a palpable and hard mass was noted in the right pelvic area. Hepatomegaly, liver masses, and ascites were absent. Initial laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 4,830/µL, hemoglobin 15.2 g/dL, platelets 138,000/µL, total protein 7.8 g/dL, albumin 4.4 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 31 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 35 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL, alkaline phosphate 98 IU/L, prothrombin time 14 second (INR 1.21), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 15.01 ng/mL, and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) 864 mAU/mL. Hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) were positive. Hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), HBV-DNA with polymerase chain reaction, and serological markers of hepatitis C were negative. He belonged to Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A.
For evaluation of the pelvic mass, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed. They demonstrated a 13×10 cm expansile mass that involved the right iliac bone (). The patient underwent an incisional biopsy with the impression of a malignant bone tumor. However, on pathological examination, the tumor was composed of polygonal cells with ample cytoplasm and trabecular pattern. In immunohistochemical stains, these tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), hepatocyte paraffin 1 (HepPar1), and glypican-3, which confirmed the diagnosis of HCC (). Tumor cells were negative for CD56, chromogranin A and synaptophysin, which are the markers of neuroendocrine differentiation. To find the primary focus, abdominal CT, MRI, positron emission tomography (PET) scans and angiography were performed. However, no tumor was found in the liver in these radiologic examinations.
We diagnosed this case as an isolated metastatic HCC of the pelvic bone without the presence of a primary cancer in the liver. Surgical resection of the tumor was recommended, but the patient refused an operation because of old age and the large size of the tumor. Instead, we decided to treat him with combined modalities. He started radiotherapy in the pelvic area with a total dose of 5,100 cGy in 17 fractions. One week after the end of radiotherapy, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed in the metastatic HCC of the pelvic bone via the right internal iliac artery (adriamycin 50 mg and 20 mL of lipiodol). Then, the patient was treated with five cycles of systemic chemotherapy based on 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU, 1,000 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3) and cisplatin (90 mg/m2 on day 2 every 4 weeks). After the completion of chemotherapy, the tumor became almost necrotic. The AFP and PIVKA-II levels decreased to the normal ranges (2.85 ng/mL and 28 mAU/mL, respectively). As the treatment resulted in near complete regression of the tumor, the patient underwent close follow-up without chemotherapy. However, 12 months after chemotherapy, a CT scan revealed multiple lung metastases in both lungs with increasing AFP and PIVKA-II levels (182 ng/mL and 38 mAU/mL, respectively). He was treated with two cycles of systemic chemotherapy with the same regimen (5-FU 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 2 and 3 and cisplatin 90 mg/m2 on day 2). After two cycles of chemotherapy, the patient refused additional chemotherapy and we provided him with supportive care thereafter.

914,21,Glasgow Coma Score (GCS),severity,integer,14,Synthetic,"A 58-year-old male was brought to the emergency department after being found disoriented and stumbling around a grocery store parking lot, according to bystanders who contacted local emergency services. On arrival, he was sitting on the curb, appearing confused and slightly agitated, with no clear indication of how long he had been in that spot or what precipitated his apparent distress. Witnesses stated that he had been seen wavering on his feet, occasionally calling out random statements that did not match any observable context. During transport, paramedics noted that he seemed restless and kept glancing around as though looking for someone, yet he maintained the ability to open his eyes with no apparent hesitation, reacting to the presence of people around him and even shifting his gaze toward movement or sound. On initial examination in the department, his vital signs showed a slightly elevated blood pressure of 142/88 mmHg, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. He had a mildly increased temperature reading of 99.2°F, although it was uncertain whether this reflected a feverish process or some other factor. He answered questions with audible speech, but the phrases he used were largely unrelated to the questions, consisting of words and references that did not align logically with the conversation. When asked his name, he provided a string of words referencing places that had no connection to his identity, though he spoke them clearly enough to be recognized as actual words. Despite this inappropriate pattern of speech, he occasionally appeared to notice the medical staff, making fleeting eye contact and switching his focus from one person to another without obvious comprehension of their roles. Examination of his motor abilities revealed that he was relatively able to move all limbs, though when asked to perform simple tasks, he offered no consistent cooperation. However, when clinical personnel applied slight pressure over his forearm and later near his clavicle as part of a neurological evaluation, he brought his hand directly to the source of discomfort and attempted to dislodge it with some accuracy. This movement suggested that, while his mental clarity was compromised, he sensed painful stimuli and could pinpoint where the sensation was located, steering the examiner’s hand away rather than merely withdrawing reflexively. His past medical records, obtained after identification through a wallet card, revealed a history of mild bipolar disorder and prior medication for hypertension, though there was no record of recent psychiatric hospitalizations or significant neurological events. He occasionally visited a primary care provider, as indicated by partial documentation of medication refills, but the last documented appointment was nearly a year prior. Further assessment showed no overt signs of head trauma or fresh bruising, though there were older marks on his arms that might have been from prior incidents or accidental bumps. His pupils were equal and responded to light, with no apparent asymmetry in response time or constriction. Cardiovascular examination showed normal heart sounds, and his lung fields were clear to auscultation, indicating no current respiratory compromise. Despite his confused verbal content, he remained sufficiently alert to notice objects placed in front of him, though he made little effort to interact meaningfully with any provided items such as a cup of water or a blanket. The team initiated basic laboratory workup, including a toxicology screen, given the unclear circumstances leading to his presentation, and imaging studies were requested to exclude intracranial processes such as hemorrhage or ischemia. Throughout this initial phase of assessment, he continued to spontaneously shift his gaze to whomever approached and occasionally mumbled words that bore no relevance to the immediate setting, suggesting a significant cognitive disturbance but leaving some intact ability to be aware of his environment. Although his speech was evidently disorganized, his purposeful reach toward uncomfortable stimuli underscored that he retained a notable aspect of protective motor function. No specific treatment had been administered at this early stage, aside from supportive care and routine precautionary measures, as the clinical team endeavored to gather further diagnostic information and identify any underlying contributors, whether metabolic, psychiatric, or neurological in nature.

According to the initial report from the individual who summoned assistance, she had been sitting there in the same position for an undetermined amount of time, with her head resting against the window and no observable reactions when they attempted to garner her attention through polite gestures. On arrival, paramedics observed that she made no effort to open her eyelids in response to normal conversation or louder vocal prompts, and even gentle attempts at nudging her shoulder elicited minimal reaction aside from occasional slow murmurs that suggested she was at least partially aware of her surroundings. She did manage to speak in incomplete but coherent phrases at times, responding to basic inquiries about how she felt, yet the content of her answers showed clear signs of disorientation. When asked about the current day or location, she provided statements that were confusing or unrelated, such as referencing an unrelated setting she believed she had just visited earlier, which conflicted with the eyewitness account that she had been parked at that convenience store for well over an hour. Her mental status appeared muddled, as she repeated some questions back and then trailed off into silence, giving no firm grasp of the reality of the situation. Despite this perplexed speech pattern, when explicitly directed to perform simple motor tasks, she demonstrated an ability to comply with specific requests. For instance, she could raise her right arm when asked, and later, she was able to release and reapply her grip on a nurse’s hand upon repeated instruction. These actions indicated that her strength and coordination were at least somewhat intact and that she was able to comprehend spoken commands on a rudimentary level. However, she continued to keep her eyes firmly shut through most of the examination, remaining passive and largely still, except when asked to move or shift as part of the clinician’s assessment. Her past medical records, retrieved from an old hospital card located in her wallet, mentioned a prior hospitalization several years ago for an ischemic stroke that allegedly left her with mild residual weakness in her left leg, although there was no documentation of any severe long-term mobility limitations. She also had a documented history of labile blood pressure, often swinging towards the higher end of normal, for which she had been prescribed medication in the past. It was unclear whether she had been adhering to that medication regimen in recent months. Family members, who were reached by telephone shortly after her arrival, mentioned that she had occasionally reported episodes of dizziness and general fatigue, but they had not noticed any acute changes in her mental status until just a few days prior, when she started to appear withdrawn and less interactive during phone calls. She reportedly had some difficulty recalling recent conversations, although she was not formally evaluated for cognitive decline. On direct questioning in the emergency department—prior to any administration of sedatives, analgesics, or other treatments—she sometimes managed a mumbled acknowledgment that she was uncomfortable but displayed no voluntary attempt to open her eyes or appropriately orient herself to the exam area. Repeated tests of her neurological function showed that she could be prompted to execute tasks involving intentional movement of limbs, such as bending her arm or lifting her foot, yet she never lifted her eyelids spontaneously or displayed any apparent reaction to vivid visual stimuli passing in front of her face. There was no active resistance to gentle manipulations, and when her blood pressure cuff inflated, she followed a request to hold her arm still and then release it on command. Her vitals revealed a heart rate slightly above normal, with borderline elevated pressure readings and respirations that were steady but somewhat shallow, though not urgently concerning. No significant cuts or bruises were found on her head or neck, and she did not complain of headache when queried. A more comprehensive workup was launched, including blood tests to check for renal function imbalances or possible infectious processes, imaging studies to rule out a new cerebrovascular event, and a toxicological screen to exclude possible external contributors. Throughout the initial evaluation period, she continued to speak in short, jumbled statements that hinted at an underlying confusion, sometimes contradicting her previously stated words without seeming to realize the disparity. Her expression remained passive, and she maintained a lack of visual engagement, even when staff gently raised her eyelids to assess pupil size and reaction. While she did show a positive response to direct commands that required purposeful limb movement, her overall presentation was one of perplexity and reduced awareness, warranting immediate investigation into potential causes of this change in mental status and persistent lack of visual opening.",What is the patient's Glasgow Coma Score?

918,21,Glasgow Coma Score (GCS),severity,integer,18,Synthetic,"A 57-year-old male was brought to the emergency department by a neighbor who found him lying on the floor of his home in the late afternoon, with his eyes already open but seemingly unaware of the voices and movement around him. According to brief information gathered from the neighbor, the patient had been in declining health for several weeks, and he had recently complained about feeling persistently weak and lightheaded, though he never clearly explained if he sought any formal medical evaluation. On arrival, he did not utter any recognizable words or make any vocal sounds despite persistent attempts by the emergency team to gain his attention with varied tones, including calmly calling his name and then slowly increasing the volume of commands. Throughout these efforts, he kept his gaze forward, blinking occasionally but failing to follow any moving objects or turn his head toward staff members. His vital signs at the time of entry suggested mild tachycardia and a blood pressure that was within a borderline range, neither acutely alarming nor completely normal. Respirations were slow but rhythmic, prompting the examining clinician to ensure that his airway remained patent, especially given his lack of any verbal output. A look into his pockets provided only a set of house keys and a folded sheet listing several medications, though it was unclear if he had been taking them consistently or if the list was up to date. Examination of his head and neck revealed a small bruise over the left temple, though the skin was not broken and there was no active bleeding; it was unclear whether this finding signaled recent trauma or an incidental bump that had occurred days earlier. Further neurological assessment showed that, while he did not offer words or audible attempts at speech, his eyes remained open the entire time without any prompting to keep them that way. When gentle touch was replaced with more focused pressure to gauge whether he would react, he did indeed respond, yet the nature of his movements was not aligned with purposeful withdrawal or an effort to push the examiner’s hand away. Instead, his limbs stiffened and extended outward, a pattern that repeated each time staff applied even moderate noxious stimuli. No clear attempt to localize or grasp at the source of discomfort was noted, though the sudden tensing of arms and legs revealed he could perceive painful sensations to some degree. A colleague from the laboratory arrived to draw blood for urgent metabolic panels, suspecting that his undetermined condition could be linked to blood sugar imbalances, electrolyte derangements, or possible renal issues given his age and uncertain medication use. The patient’s skin was somewhat cool, and staff observed a faint film of perspiration on his forehead, but there was no frank cyanosis. Pupils were symmetrical and responded to light, though he neither tracked the flashlight nor blinked at direct visual cues. The neighbor mentioned that he had lived alone for at least a decade without close family nearby, so it was unclear if he had a recent infection, an underlying cardiac condition, or any psychiatric history that might have led to his current state. No strong odors of alcohol or other substances were detected, and there were no obvious pill bottles scattered around the immediate area where he was found. Nonetheless, toxicology screening was also arranged to explore whether an unintentional or deliberate ingestion might have contributed to this presentation. Imaging of his head and cervical spine was ordered promptly to rule out an acute traumatic injury or bleed, particularly given the bruise on his temple and the lack of clear historical detail as to how he ended up on the floor. Prior to any interventions, he remained on the stretcher with his eyes still open, his posture rigid whenever discomfort was introduced, and no sign of an attempt to speak or mouth words despite repeated efforts by the team to elicit a verbal reaction. The clinical staff stood by for rapid intervention if his breathing deteriorated or if further evidence of a more serious neurologic compromise emerged, keeping open lines of communication with diagnostic services to clarify the cause of his unresponsive state.

Impaired growth was noted (weight 39.5 kg; height 146 cm; BMI 17.6 kg/m). She had a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 226/136 mmHg, respiration rate of 16 breaths per minute and arterial oxygen saturation of 96%. Blood analysis showed a serum creatinine level of 10.97 mg/dl (nv 0.5-1.1) and urea 109 mg/dL (nv 16-46) mmol/L. The patient also presented with bilateral AMLs, hypertension and seizure disorder. Her relatives reported difficulty in managing her home medications (antihypertensive and antiepileptic drugs) due to her intellectual disability. The patient had been diagnosed with TSC in childhood; there was a paternal family history of TSC. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in end-stage renal failure appeared four years prior and the patient has been undergoing peritoneal dialysis since the diagnosis. At the age of 18 years, she underwent a prior unilateral endovascular embolization to treat renal aneurisms and the procedure successfully stopped a bleeding aneurism at the upper pole of the right kidney. Based on the patient’s medical history, clinical and biochemical findings, a ruptured renal artery aneurysm was diagnosed. An urgent renal AE was considered the treatment of choice to limit hemorrhage and the risk of damage to the peritoneal dialysis catheter. The multidisciplinary team, including pediatric surgeons, interventional radiologists, pediatric nephrologists and psychologists agreed upon the choice to perform a bilateral renal AE in this complex patient. Prior to the intervention, and after being informed on the nature of the intervention, the patient and the patient’s parents gave their written consent to undergo endovascular treatment. Under general anesthesia, ultrasound-guided right femoral common artery access was gained using a Terumo 6 FR 11 cm catheter. A diagnostic plain angiography scan revealed a double right renal artery. The major artery was easily catheterized with a 6 FR C2 Mac Boston-Scientific 6 F (65 cm) catheter. Through this catheter, a AMplatzer Plug-2 10 mm was released achieving artery occlusion (about 1 cm from the ostium, ). A Sim1 Boston-Scientific 5 fr was positioned in the lower right renal artery and several Terumo Azur coils were released (). Upon completion of the intervention, angiography confirmed the complete embolization of the vessels (). The same procedure was used for the left renal embolization using a Cobra C2 catheter and Terumo 4x10 mm Azur coils (). With the final angiography, bilateral renal arterialthrombosis was confirmed (about 1 cm from the ostium, ). The first cm of the renal artery was preserved to facilitate clamping during the future nephrectomy. After the procedure, the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of our institution for observation and subsequently to the pediatric nephrology unit. Vital signs were monitored; her postoperative course was uneventful. Two months later, the patient underwent a bilateral lumbotomy and bilateral extraperitoneal nephrectomy to protect the peritoneal surface area and dialysis adequacy. Grossly, both kidneys were enlarged (left 14.5x7x6 cm; right 15x5x5.5 cm); macroscopically the tissue was almost entirely replaced by cysts alternating with solid grey and brown areas, on a background of soft and yellowish tissue with calcific deposits. Histologically, solid areas on the yellowish background were revealed to be angiomyolipoma, which extended to the adipose tissue, perirenal and the renal pelvis. Partially solid aspects (epithelioid angiomyolipoma) and partially cystic aspects (cysts with cubic or hobnail epithelium) were observed. In the right kidney, other solid greyish areas were observed (maximum diameter 15 mm); these were classified as renal cell carcinomas (RCC), with acinar, papillary and alveolar growth patterns and cribiform aspects, Furhrman grade III (). The patient was discharged on the fourth day of hospitalization in stable clinical condition. Her clinical condition and laboratory tests were stable at 12 months follow-up. The patient undergoes continuous peritoneal dialysis.","Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?

She was a case of hypothyroidism since last 4 years on oral thyroxine 50 mcg once a day. Her laboratory investigations were within normal limits except that liver function test showed serum albumin of 2.1 g/L initially which improved to 3.4 g/L with high protein formula feed for 1-month period of evaluation and optimization. Preoperative electrocardiogram and 2D-echocardiogram were normal. Her effort tolerance was more than 4 METs. Preoperative pulmonary function test (PFT) showed FEV1 1.13 Litres (47.3% of predicted) with moderate restriction due to the lung metastases with small airway obstruction. Patient was started on bronchodilator therapy for the same. Diffusion capacity (DLCO) was 81% of predicted. A written informed consent was taken for surgery and anaesthesia. She was kept fasting for solid food for 8 hours. She received clear carbohydrate drink in previous evening and morning of surgery as per institutional protocol. In the operating room, ECG, non-invasive blood pressure and pulse oximetry were attached and base line parameters noted. A 16G intravenous cannula was secured and epidural catheter was placed in T7-8 interspace in left lateral position. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl (100 mcg), propofol (110 mg) and vecuronium (6mg) and was maintained on sevoflurane in a gaseous mixture of oxygen with nitrous oxide. The monitoring was then advanced to include invasive arterial blood pressure with pulse pressure variation (PPV), central venous pressure and monitoring with the help of FloTrac including cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume (SV), stroke volume index and stroke volume variation (SVV), as well as oesophageal temperature monitoring. CRS phase was started and total peritonectomy with total abdominal hysterectomy plus omenectomy, splenectomy, cholecystectomy and liver portal metastasis clearance was done. Bilateral diaphragmatic stripping was done for metastatic deposits. Debulking surgery of left thorax (large deposits over left lung) through left phrenotomy was done for pleural and lung PMP. A small part of left lower lobe was also resected. During debulking of thorax, a very low tidal volume (4 ml/kg) ventilation was started. CRS phase lasted for 12 hours with a total volume loss (blood mixed) during CRS phase was 6.5 liter, mostly constituted by jelly-like mucinous material. During abdominal debulking, fluid therapy was guided by PPV and SVV but after opening of pleura fluid therapy was guided by delta SV with optimum SV and target SV (10% less than optimum SV) calculation. Six units of packed red cells, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma and 500 ml of 20% albumin was given along with 6 liters of crystalloids and low dose (<0.1 μg/kg/min) nor-adrenaline support was needed toward end of CRS phase. Urine output target during CRS was more than 0.5 ml/kg/h. Total peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) was 39 with completion cytoreduction score of 1. HITAC in form of adriamycin 15 mg/m2 and mitomycin 15 mg/m2 was given in left side of thorax with open diaphragm and whole abdomen for 60 minutes with help of Belmont pump. A urine output of more than 2 ml/kg/h was targeted during HITAC phase by use of cold fluids. Temperature control was done with cold fluids at 6°C and ice packs on neck and axilla. The maximum temperature reached was 37.8°C after 40 minutes of starting HITAC. ScvO2 at end of CRS was 75.6% and at the end of HITAC phase it was 83.4%. Serum lactates increased from 1.10 mmol/L at the end of CRS phase to 8.02 mmol/L at the end of 60 minutes HITAC phase. Peak airway pressure increased from 23 to 30 cm of H2O during HITAC phase. At the end of procedure loop ileostomy was done and diaphragm was closed, drains were put in abdomen and bilateral chest tubes were placed and abdomen was closed. The patient maintained a moderate metabolic acidosis of pH 7.2-7.3 throughout the HITAC. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) mechanically ventilated and sedated. In the ICU, she was electively ventilated for 48 hours. The trachea was extubated on high flow nasal oxygenation by Optiflow™. On postoperative day (POD) 1, parenteral nutrition was started. Adequate pain relief was achieved by epidural infusion of local anaesthetic for 4 days along with intravenous paracetamol 1 g 6 hourly. She was shifted out from ICU on POD 7.

356,23,MELD Na (UNOS/OPTN),lab test,decimal,11,Synthetic,"A 59-year-old female with a multi-year history of alcohol-related liver disease arrived at the emergency department after a sudden episode of bright red vomiting accompanied by marked weakness, near-fainting spells, and profound fatigue over the preceding week. She noted that, over the past month, her skin appeared increasingly jaundiced, and she had been experiencing episodic upper abdominal swelling and discomfort. On presentation, she was visibly pale, with an unsteady gait and a reduced ability to focus, raising immediate concerns about the severity of her condition. Upon further interviewing, she revealed prior admissions for liver-related complications, including episodes of confusion likely linked to her underlying disease, but she did not recall needing repeated external filtration procedures in recent days. Examination at the bedside showed intermittent tachycardia, a blood pressure hovering at the lower limit of normal, and cool extremities suggestive of a possible low circulating volume. Palpation of her abdomen revealed tense swelling, consistent with fluid accumulation secondary to chronic portal hypertension, and she described resistance to typical diuretic medication regimens at home. She also reported that, in the months leading up to this admission, her alcohol intake had been oscillating between abstinence attempts and frequent binge episodes, which often ended in fatigue and abdominal pain. Inspection of her sclera revealed a prominent yellowish discoloration, affirming the history of worsening jaundice. She had developed several bruises on her forearms, possibly reflecting an inadequate clotting mechanism in the context of advanced liver dysfunction. Her mental status was compromised—she appeared disoriented to time and occasionally trailed off mid-sentence, but she remained aware that she had a significant bleed and required urgent medical assistance. Laboratory results at the time of this evaluation uncovered evidence of impaired clotting function, with an INR of 2.0, which was distinctly above normal and heightened her risk of ongoing bleeding. Further lab data revealed moderately reduced kidney performance, as demonstrated by a serum creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL, consistent with her reported decrease in urine output over recent days. She also displayed mild hyponatremia, reflected by a serum sodium of 133 mEq/L, adding to the overall picture of fluid and electrolyte imbalances typically observed in advanced cirrhosis. Her bilirubin concentration reached 2.2 mg/dL, aligning with the physical signs of jaundice and suggesting active hepatic injury. Throughout the interview, she lamented her inability to adhere to recommended dietary modifications, having forfeited regular meals once she began feeling persistently nauseated. She also felt her belly had become noticeably more distended in the days leading up to this emergency visit, describing a sense of fullness limiting her daily activities. Physical examination highlighted multiple vascular markings on her trunk, including small, spider-like formations indicative of chronic liver injury. Lung auscultation identified faint crackles at the bases, possibly due to fluid shifts or suboptimal ventilation in the setting of profound fatigue. Her overall presentation was consistent with acute gastrointestinal bleeding superimposed on advanced liver impairment, with both hemodynamic instability and significant coagulopathy dominating her immediate clinical picture. Imaging was arranged to assess for dilated vessels in her upper GI tract and rule out other acute abnormalities, though no interventions were initiated before the labs were drawn. She was placed under close monitoring in a high-acuity setting, with resuscitation measures begun concomitantly. Despite her confusion, she acknowledged the seriousness of her circumstances and expressed regret over missed opportunities to maintain sobriety or attend follow-up visits for her chronic condition. Her caregivers were promptly alerted, and a multidisciplinary team was readied to address both the urgent bleeding concern and the wide-reaching effects of her advanced disease. Given the severity of her hepatic dysfunction, her ongoing bleeding risk, and her compromised renal status, the next steps involved intensive observation, further diagnostic measures to identify the exact source of bleeding, and a careful approach to restoring hemodynamic stability, all while respecting the precarious balance her chronic condition demanded. ",What is the patient's MELD Na score? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.,"{'Dialysis at least twice in the past week': False, 'international normalized ratio': 2.0, 'creatinine': [1.9, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [133, 'mEq/L'], 'Bilirubin': [2.2, 'mg/dL']}",25.0,23.75,26.25,"The formula for computing the MELD Na is to first apply the following equation: MELD(i) = 0.957 x ln(Cr) + 0.378 x ln(bilirubin) + 1.120 x ln(INR) + 0.643.
If the MELD(i) is greater than 11 after rounding to the nearest tenth and multiplying the MELD(i) by 10, we apply the following equation: MELD = MELD(i) + 1.32 x (137 - Na) -  [ 0.033 x MELD(i) x (137 - Na)]. The MELD Na score is capped at 40. The concentration of Na is mEq/L, the concentration of bilirubin is mg/dL, and the concentration of creatinine is mg/dL. If the patient's Na concentration is less than 125 mEq/L, we set it to 125 mEq/L and if the patient's the Na concentration is greater 137 mEq/L, we round it to 137 mEq/L.
The concentration of creatinine is 1.9 mg/dL. 
The patient has not went through dialysis at least twice in the past week.
Whether the patient has went through continuous veno-venous hemodialysis in the past 24 hours is not mentioned, and so we assume this to be false.
The concentration of bilirubin is 2.2 mg/dL. 
The patient's INR is 2.0. 
The concentration of sodium is 133 mEq/L. 
Applying the first equation gives us 0.957 x ln(1.9) + 0.378 x ln(2.2) + 1.120 x ln(2.0) + 0.643 = 2.331615893511815. Rounding to the nearest tenth makes the MELD (i) score 2.3. We then multiply by 10, making the MELD(i) score 23.
Because the MELD (i) score is greater than 11, we then apply the second equation, giving us 23 + 1.32 x (137 - 133) -  [0.033 x 2.331615893511815 x (137 - 133)] = 25.
The MELD Na score is less than 40, and so we keep the score as it is. The patient's MELDNa score, rounded to the nearest integer, is 25 points."

She had been complaining of worsening fatigue, intermittent abdominal swelling, and increasing difficulty with her usual activities over the prior week, with her family noting that she appeared more jaundiced than usual and had been sleeping for longer stretches during the day. On arrival, she was alert but visibly distressed, complaining of persistent nausea and reporting dizziness upon attempting to stand. Vital signs revealed tachycardia and relatively low blood pressure, raising immediate concerns about volume depletion. Examination of her abdomen disclosed severe ascites and prominent venous patterns around her umbilicus. She also had a mild yellowish discoloration of the sclera, consistent with ongoing issues related to impaired hepatic function. In further discussions, the patient reported that, due to worsening fluid balance and related metabolic derangements, she had needed specialized external filtration sessions on more than one occasion over the preceding several days; she admitted that these episodes were arranged by her renal care team to manage her increasingly unstable electrolyte and fluid status. Further detail revealed that her medical history included multiple admissions for alcoholic liver inflammation and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which had previously been attributed to varices diagnosed during endoscopic evaluations. She even recollected having undergone procedures aimed at reducing portal venous pressure in the past, indicating that her portal hypertension had been a major source of complications. At this current visit, laboratory tests conducted soon after her arrival showed a modest elevation in her total bilirubin at 1.5 mg/dL, reflective of impaired hepatic clearance but not as severe as in some of her past events. Her kidney function assessment demonstrated a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, suggesting that, while her renal function was not dramatically compromised, there was sufficient concern to have warranted the recent interventions to help stabilize her fluid balance. Additionally, her sodium was measured in the 143 mEq/L, indicating that, at least at the time of this evaluation, she was not manifesting the hyponatremia that can sometimes accompany advanced cirrhosis, though she did complain of intermittent muscle cramps in her lower extremities. Of particular note, her coagulation studies revealed a marked prolongation of her clotting parameters, with an INR of 2.2, mirroring her repeated history of compromised synthetic function. From a clinical standpoint, the combination of her coagulopathy, the presence of tense ascites, and her ongoing high-risk drinking patterns created a precarious situation in which variceal bleeding could readily become life-threatening without prompt intervention. As the evaluating team arranged immediate gastroenterology consultation for endoscopic therapy, attention was also directed toward supporting her hemodynamic status and correcting her coagulopathy as appropriate. She continued to retch small amounts of blood-streaked fluid throughout her initial assessment, prompting additional measures to ensure airway protection. Despite her fatigue, she was oriented to her circumstances, though she required frequent redirection and reassurance. She remarked that her skin had become increasingly itchy over the past couple of weeks and that she had experienced sporadic dark urine, both of which had served as clues of advancing liver dysfunction from her perspective. Nevertheless, she had not sought timely medical attention previously due to reluctance to return for repeated hospitalization. Overall, her presentation at this point illustrated a classic pattern of advanced alcohol-related liver damage, including bleeding from the esophageal region likely exacerbated by the chronic pressure changes in her portal system, with lab findings indicating mild hyperbilirubinemia, moderate coagulation abnormalities, stable though at-risk kidney parameters, and balanced serum sodium, all occurring in the context of recent extra help in managing her renal and fluid status prior to admission. ",What is the patient's MELD Na score? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.,"{'Dialysis at least twice in the past week': True, 'international normalized ratio': 2.2, 'creatinine': [1.2, 'mg/dL'], 'Sodium': [143, 'mEq/L'], 'Bilirubin': [1.5, 'mg/dL']}",30.0,28.5,31.5,"The formula for computing the MELD Na is to first apply the following equation: MELD(i) = 0.957 x ln(Cr) + 0.378 x ln(bilirubin) + 1.120 x ln(INR) + 0.643.
If the MELD(i) is greater than 11 after rounding to the nearest tenth and multiplying the MELD(i) by 10, we apply the following equation: MELD = MELD(i) + 1.32 x (137 - Na) -  [ 0.033 x MELD(i) x (137 - Na)]. The MELD Na score is capped at 40. The concentration of Na is mEq/L, the concentration of bilirubin is mg/dL, and the concentration of creatinine is mg/dL. If the patient's Na concentration is less than 125 mEq/L, we set it to 125 mEq/L and if the patient's the Na concentration is greater 137 mEq/L, we round it to 137 mEq/L.
The concentration of creatinine is 1.2 mg/dL. 
The patient is reported to have went through dialysis at least twice in the past week.
Whether the patient has went through continuous veno-venous hemodialysis in the past 24 hours is not mentioned, and so we assume this to be false.
Because the patient has went through at least one of (i) dialysis two or more times in the past 7 days or (ii) continuous veno-venous hemodialysis in the past 24 hours, we set the creatinine concentration to 4.0 mg/dL.
The concentration of bilirubin is 1.5 mg/dL. 
The patient's INR is 2.2. 
The concentration of sodium is 143 mEq/L. The sodium concentration is greater than 137 mEq/L, and so we set the sodium concentration to 137 mEq/L.
Applying the first equation gives us 0.957 x ln(4.0) + 0.378 x ln(1.5) + 1.120 x ln(2.2) + 0.643 = 3.0060217580646036. Rounding to the nearest tenth makes the MELD (i) score 3.0. We then multiply by 10, making the MELD(i) score 30.
Because the MELD (i) score is greater than 11, we then apply the second equation, giving us 30 + 1.32 x (137 - 137) -  [0.033 x 3.0060217580646036 x (137 - 137)] = 30.
The MELD Na score is less than 40, and so we keep the score as it is. The patient's MELDNa score, rounded to the nearest integer, is 30 points."

The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.
Two days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.
Past medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.
Physical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.
Initial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.
At the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.
Renal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.
Physical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.
Renal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.
The patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.",What is the patient's MELD Na score?

361,25,HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk,risk,integer,1,Synthetic,"A 72-year-old man was seen in the cardiology office after being referred by his primary clinician for reassessment of anticoagulation in the setting of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that was first documented five years ago during an emergency department visit for palpitations. He reports that his heart rhythm symptoms have been well controlled on metoprolol succinate 75 mg daily, and he has remained in sinus rhythm since a direct-current cardioversion performed six months earlier, but because of a recent episode of self-limited macroscopic hematuria his primary clinician requested a comprehensive review of factors that could influence bleeding risk. Today he describes no chest pain, dyspnea, focal neurologic complaints, or syncope. His blood pressure in the clinic, measured manually after five minutes of seated rest, is 168/92 mm Hg; he states that home readings are usually “in the 150s” despite adherence to lisinopril 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily. He has stage 3b chronic kidney disease attributed to hypertensive nephrosclerosis; baseline serum creatinine has fluctuated between 2.1 and 2.6 mg/dL over the past year, with the most recent value from last week at 2.4 mg/dL (eGFR approximately 28 mL/min/1.73 m²). He denies ever having been told of cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, or alcohol-related liver injury, and last month’s comprehensive metabolic panel showed AST 28 U/L, ALT 31 U/L, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL, and normal albumin. There is no personal history of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or intracranial hemorrhage, and he has never experienced retinal or spinal cord ischemic events. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with a drug-eluting stent in the mid-left anterior descending artery four years ago and has remained on aspirin 81 mg daily since that time; he takes naproxen 220 mg up to twice daily for lumbar osteoarthritis flare-ups, most recently two days ago after mowing his lawn. His other daily medications include warfarin (most recent INR 2.3), rosuvastatin 10 mg, and omeprazole 20 mg. He states he drinks two glasses of red wine on Friday and Saturday evenings, totalling 4 drinks per week, and otherwise denies liquor or beer consumption. He has never smoked cigarettes and quit chewing tobacco three decades ago. Family history is notable for a father who died of myocardial infarction at age 62 and a mother with age-related macular degeneration; no first-degree relatives have bleeding disorders. Review of systems is negative for melena, hematemesis, easy bruising, gingival bleeding, epistaxis, or abdominal tenderness. On examination he is alert and oriented, BMI 29 kg/m², pulse 68 bpm regular, respirations 16/min, and afebrile. Cardiovascular exam reveals normal S1 and S2 without murmurs or gallops; carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly, and there is no ascites. Extremities show no edema or petechiae; radial and dorsalis pedis pulses are intact. Neurologic exam is nonfocal with normal strength, sensation, and coordination. Laboratory data available from this morning include hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL, hematocrit 39 %, platelets 210 × 10⁹/L, BUN 48 mg/dL, sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.3 mmol/L, and INR pending. Urinalysis confirms trace protein and 5–10 red blood cells per high-power field without casts. An electrocardiogram obtained today shows normal sinus rhythm at 67 bpm, PR interval 180 ms, QRS 96 ms, QTc 430 ms, and no acute ischemic changes. A recent transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 %, mild concentric hypertrophy, and left atrial enlargement measuring 4.4 cm, with no valvular vegetations or thrombus.

369,25,HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk,risk,integer,7,Synthetic,"A 70-year-old woman came to the electrophysiology follow-up clinic at her referring internist’s request to re-evaluate long-term oral anticoagulation in the setting of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation that had first been identified on a routine pre-operative ECG sixteen months ago. Since that time she has been taking warfarin, but she relates considerable difficulty maintaining a steady anticoagulation intensity: during the past half-year her home INR log supplied by the anticoagulation service shows values swinging from 1.6 to 4.1 despite dose adjustments, and she recalls two telephone calls from the clinic instructing her to hold doses and repeat testing because the value was above the therapeutic window. She denies ever needing reversal agents, hospital admission, transfusion, endoscopy, or surgical intervention for hemorrhage, but she does remember a prolonged gingival ooze after a dental cleaning three months earlier and a self-limited superficial epistaxis episode after using a home humidifier in winter. She has never experienced black or bloody stools, hematemesis, hematuria, or bruising large enough to raise concern. Her medical history is otherwise notable for well-controlled type 2 diabetes managed with metformin 500 mg twice daily, dyslipidemia treated with atorvastatin 20 mg nightly, postmenopausal osteoporosis for which she takes weekly alendronate, seasonal allergic rhinitis controlled with nasal corticosteroid spray, and remote nicotine dependence; she smoked one pack per day for twenty years but quit fifteen years ago. She has never been told she has high blood pressure, and serial printouts from her community pharmacy’s automated cuff over the past year show systolic readings consistently in the 110s-120s mm Hg range, with today’s seated manual measurement 123/74 mm Hg and a heart rate of 78 beats per minute that is irregularly irregular. She denies transient ischemic attack, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, carotid disease, or peripheral embolic events. She has no personal history of chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcohol-related liver injury, or jaundice; a comprehensive metabolic panel drawn last week for her primary care visit documented AST 24 U/L, ALT 26 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 68 U/L, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, and albumin 4.2 g/dL. Kidney function has been unremarkable, with a stable creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL and estimated glomerular filtration rate of 68 mL/min/1.73 m²; she has never had nephrolithiasis, proteinuric disorders, or dialytic therapy. She is not taking antiplatelet agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or herbal supplements known to increase bleeding tendency; for episodic knee discomfort from old athletic injuries she uses acetaminophen 650 mg as needed, typically twice a week. She denies a family history of hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, aneurysms, or premature sudden death. Review of systems today is negative for chest pain, dyspnea at rest, exertional intolerance, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, abdominal pain, early satiety, pruritus, overt ascites, confusion, or peripheral edema. She remains physically active, walking her dog two miles most mornings and participating in low-impact aerobics at the community center. Socially she lives with her spouse and enjoys a nightly glass or two of white wine with dinner, plus a couple of champagne mimosas during Sunday brunch, amounting to roughly ten alcoholic drinks each week; she does not use recreational drugs and only drinks coffee otherwise. On examination she is well appearing with a body mass index of 26 kg/m², afebrile, and breathing comfortably. Cardiac auscultation reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops; jugular venous pressure is not elevated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, nontender, and without organomegaly or palpable masses. There is no scleral icterus, telangiectasia, spider nevi, palmar erythema, or digital clubbing. Extremities show no edema, petechiae, ecchymoses, or palpable purpura, and peripheral pulses are full and symmetric. Neurologic screening exam demonstrates intact cranial nerves, normal motor strength and tone, and no cerebellar signs. Laboratory tests drawn immediately before the visit reveal hemoglobin 13.4 g/dL, hematocrit 40%, platelets 232 × 10⁹/L, white blood cell count 6.1 × 10⁹/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.1 mmol/L, and INR 1.8. A twelve-lead electrocardiogram obtained in the office shows atrial fibrillation with an average ventricular rate of 76/min, normal QRS axis and duration, and no acute ST-T abnormalities. A transthoracic echocardiogram performed three months earlier indicated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, normal right ventricular size and function, mild left atrial enlargement, trivial mitral regurgitation, and no intracardiac thrombus. She expresses interest in learning whether continuing warfarin, switching to a direct oral anticoagulant, or considering rhythm control strategies would best balance her desire to avoid both stroke and future bleeding episodes as she plans international travel later this year.",What is the patient's HAS-BLED score?

378,25,HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk,risk,integer,22,Synthetic,"A 53-year-old man was seen in the subspecialty arrhythmia clinic to review his chronic oral anticoagulation in the setting of paroxysmal non-valvular atrial fibrillation detected eight months earlier during an urgent care visit for sudden palpitations. Four months before that arrhythmia was discovered, he experienced an embolic left parietal ischemic stroke documented on magnetic resonance imaging; a brief inpatient course of intravenous heparin was transitioned to warfarin at discharge, and he completed a structured rehabilitation program with full recovery of speech and motor function. Since initiation of warfarin his community pharmacy–based service has logged weekly international normalized ratios between 2.2 and 2.6 with no dose interruptions, vitamin K rescues, or emergency evaluations, yielding a calculated time in therapeutic range greater than 75 %. He brings printouts of the past twelve INR checks that confirm this consistency. The patient’s medical history is otherwise notable for biopsy-proven non-alcoholic steatohepatitis that evolved three years ago into compensated cirrhosis; the most recent comprehensive metabolic panel, drawn one week prior to today’s visit, demonstrated alanine aminotransferase 68 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 74 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 136 U/L, total bilirubin 1.9 mg/dL, albumin 3.4 g/dL, and international normalized ratio 2.4 on his usual dose, with platelet count 142 × 10⁹/L. He has never manifested ascites, encephalopathy, variceal hemorrhage, or peripheral edema, yet hepatology follows him semi-annually and he underwent screening upper endoscopy six months ago that showed only mild portal hypertensive gastropathy without varices. He denies any kidney problems, and outpatient laboratory records over the past year list serum creatinine values between 0.8 and 0.9 mg/dL with estimated glomerular filtration rates consistently above 90 mL/min/1.73 m². Home blood-pressure readings provided on his smartphone average 116/74 mm Hg, and today’s seated manual measurement after five minutes of rest is 118/72 mm Hg with a pulse that is irregularly irregular at 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate 14 per minute, temperature 36.7 °C, and oxygen saturation 97 % on ambient air. Because of the prior cerebrovascular event his neurologist added enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg daily for antiplatelet synergy, and for chronic right knee osteoarthritis he self-administers over-the-counter ibuprofen 400 mg two or three times per week, most recently yesterday after mowing the lawn. Mood disorder screening several years ago led to initiation of sertraline 50 mg each morning, a regimen he continues. He is otherwise not taking clopidogrel, dipyridamole, corticosteroids, herbal supplements, or over-the-counter preparations marketed for “natural blood thinning.” He works full-time as an accountant, swims three mornings per week, and lives with his spouse; they are childless. Social history reveals he stopped smoking cigarettes a decade ago after a 12-pack-year exposure and denies recreational drug use. Regarding alcohol, he candidly reports drinking two pints of craft beer after work on most weekdays and four or five mixed drinks while socializing on Saturday evenings, amounting to approximately 24 alcoholic beverages each week; he acknowledges occasional weekend binges in the past but states he now spaces consumption evenly. Review of systems today is negative for epistaxis, gingival bleeding, hematuria, melena, hematochezia, easy bruising, light-headedness, jaundice progression, abdominal distension, pruritus, confusion, chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, leg swelling, visual disturbance, or new neurologic deficits. Physical examination shows an alert, well-nourished man with body mass index 26 kg/m², anicteric sclerae with only faint conjunctival injection, moist oral mucosa without petechiae, supple neck without jugular venous distention, clear lung fields, a nondisplaced apical impulse, variable S1 intensity without murmurs or extra sounds, and a soft, mildly enlarged liver palpable 2 cm below the costal margin but nontender; no splenomegaly, shifting dullness, or caput medusae are detected. Skin inspection reveals no spider angiomata, ecchymoses, or purpura, and distal pulses are intact. Neurologic screening demonstrates normal cranial nerves, full strength, and steady gait. A 12-lead electrocardiogram performed in clinic confirms atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response at 80 beats per minute and no acute ST-T abnormalities. Point-of-care hemoglobin is 14.1 g/dL and platelet count, as noted above, is 142 × 10⁹/L. The patient wishes to discuss whether remaining on warfarin, switching to a direct oral anticoagulant, or exploring a left atrial appendage occlusion would provide the most favorable balance between ischemic stroke prevention and hemorrhagic risk in light of his liver condition, concurrent use of agents that can impair hemostasis, and substantial alcohol intake; he expresses a commitment to maintaining stable weight, moderating beverage consumption, coordinating with hepatology on beta-blocker prophylaxis if portal pressure rises, and continuing meticulous home monitoring of blood pressure while shared decision-making proceeds.",What is the patient's HAS-BLED score?

His past history was remarkable for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), secondary polycythemia, pulmonary hypertension, and old pulmonary tuberculosis. He was maintained on salbutamol inhaler, fluticasone, and salmetrol discus inhaler, theophylline and home oxygen therapy. He denied receiving systemic corticosteroids in the preceding year. He was an ex-smoker and alcohol drinker. Physical examination on admission revealed an ill looking, dyspneic patient with a temperature 38.4°C, blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg, pulse rate 160/minute, and respiratory rate 36/minute. Chest examination revealed expiratory wheezes and bilateral basal crepitations. Otherwise, physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations revealed hemoglobin 13 mg/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) 14.6×109 /L (neutrophils 82%, lymphocytes 10%), platelets 25×109 /L, glucose 11.4 mmol/L, creatinine 135 mmol/L, sodium 129 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L. Arterial blood gases revealed pH 7.19, PCO2 74.8 mm Hg, PO2 96 mm Hg. Chest radiograph showed no lung infiltrates. Sputum culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, sensitive to cefipime and ciprofloxacin; however, it was thought to represent colonization. A diagnosis of COPD with acute exacerbation was made, for which he was given intravenous ceftriaxone 2 gm once daily, azithromycin 500 mg once daily, methylprednisolone 40 mg three times daily, and salbutamol and ipratropium bromide nebulizers. He made a gradual improvement, and after seven days he was shifted to oral prednisolone 40 mg once daily and oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid to complete two weeks of antibiotics. Prednisolone was given for a total of 13 days. Three weeks after admission he developed hemoptysis, chest tightness, and worsening cough. Sputum culture grew P aeruginosa for which he was given intravenous cefepime and ciprofloxacin. Sputum smear for acid fast bacilli (AFB) was negative. Because of worsening respiratory status and a chest radiograph showing an infiltrate involving the whole left lung and part of the right lung, bronchoscopy was performed on 27 January 2005. No endobronchial lesion was found. Antituberculous drugs in the form of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol were started. Bronchioalveolar lavage and bronchial wash were negative for AFB but bacterial culture grew P aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebisella pneumoniae. Cytologic examination of the bronchial wash and lavage revealed bronchial epithelial cells, few squamous cells in the background of numerous S stercoralis worms () and bacteria with inflammatory cells and blood. Transbronchial biopsy showed only intraalveolar hemorrhage with anthracotic pigments, but was negative for granuloma, viral inclusions, or malignancy. He was treated with oral ivermectin 12mg once daily. Two days later he complained of vomiting, lower abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and constipation. Physical examination revealed abdominal distention, lower abdominal tenderness, and sluggish bowel sounds. A plain radiograph of the abdomen revealed distended bowel loops but no air fluid levels. Lapratomy was done. The findings at surgery were a dilated jejunum and ileum filled with stool. Microscopic examination of the resected part of the ileum bowel revealed acute inflammation, mucosal hemorrhage, and focal ulceration with abundant S stercoralis larvae (Figures and ). Postoperatively, he was mechanically ventilated. His postoperative course was complicated by hypotension and multiorgan failure and he expired after two days.","What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration for hyperglycemia in terms of mEq/L?

The concentration of sodium is 129.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 129.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 129.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 129.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 129.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 129.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of glucose is 11.4 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 11.4 mmol. To convert 11.4 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 11.4 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.0114 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.0114 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 2.05382 g glucose. To convert 2.05382 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 2.05382 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 2053.82 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 2053.82 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 205.382 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 11.4 mmol glucose/L converts to 205.382 mg glucose/dL. 
Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 129.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (205.382 - 100) = 131.52917 mEq/L.

We noticed that in his medical history, leeches were applied to treat the diabetic wounds on his feet two hours before he attended our clinic. After this, the leeches spontaneously detached but he observed bleeding from his bites and bleeding did not stop in spite of compression with tight bandages. A review of the patient’s past medical history revealed hypertension, diabetes mellitus, diabetic foot, ischemic heart disease and coronary artery bypass surgery.
Vital signs were as follows; fever: 36.6°C, blood pressure: 85/50 mmHg, heart rate: 112/min and respiratory rate: 28/min. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the whole abdomen. Ampulla was empty with rectal examination. There was an ulcerative lesion with size 5x3 cm on the site of the amputated first toe. Additionally, there were multiple bites due to leech therapy on both feet (Figure ).
Laboratory tests indicated the following: hemoglobin: 7.6 g/dL, white blood cells: 9370/mm3, platelets: 147000/mL, blood urea nitrogen: 29.1 mg/dL, creatinine: 1.98 mg/dL, glucose: 527 mg/dL, Na: 127 mmol/L, K: 6 mmol/L, CL: 94.5 mmol/L, C-reactive protein: 1.27 mg/dL and other routine blood tests and coagulation functions were all normal. Blood gas analysis revealed pH: 7.26, pO2: 86 mmHg, and bicarbonate: 20.2 mmol/L. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) showed gas in the intrahepatic biliary ducts. No obstructive pathology was found to mesenteric blood flow on Doppler USG. CT without intravenous contrast was performed because of abnormal renal function tests. CT revealed gas near the stomach, among colon segments (pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, PSI) and intrahepatic biliary ducts in central and left hepatic lobe (hepatic portal venous gas, HPVG) (Figure , Figure , respectively).
The patient was referred to another hospital that had an intensive care unit and started conservative treatment with antibiotics and intravenous fluid. Twelve hours after treatment, his general condition did not improve and signs of diffused peritonitis were observed on abdominal examination. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy. Necrosis was found in the terminal ileum and the entire colon during laparotomy. Doppler USG detected low flow in the vessels supplying these necrotic segments. However, resection was decided due to necrosis of these segments. These necrotic intestinal segments were resected and an end-ileostomy was performed. He had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the 17th postoperative day.","What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration for hyperglycemia in terms of mEq/L?

Traces of sugar and albumin (++) were present in the urine examination. The fecal occult blood was found in the stool. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not detected in sputum in the acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain.
The chest X-ray was normal. Ultrasonography (USG) of the abdomen and pelvis and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed normal findings. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan of chest and abdomen showed asymmetric circumferential thickening in the ileocaecal region with lobulated thickened caecum, soft-tissue stranding and necrotic mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and indeterminate lobule in the lung (). Colonoscopy showed multiple transverse ulcers with overlying exudates in terminal ileum and ascending and transverse colon. Histopathological examination of the ileum and colon showed patchy ulcers with exudates, granulation tissue, fibrosis, deep lymphoplasmocytic inflammation, and crypt regenerative changes with fibrinoid changes in scattered capillaries and venules and was inconclusive. However, gene XPERT was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

His vital signs were initially normal, however, after an episode of hematemesis followed by hematochezia, he became hypotensive to 80/60 mmHg and tachycardic to 100 beats/min. Physical examination was notable for pale conjunctiva and tenderness to palpation in the upper abdomen. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell count of 13.2 x 103/uL (reference (R): 4.5-11.0 x 103/uL), hemoglobin of 5.9 g/dL (R: 12-17 g/dL), blood urea nitrogen of 34 mg/dL (R: 5-25 mg/dL), and creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL (R: 0.6-1.8 mg/dL). CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a 6.8 cm dilated proximal jejunum (Figure ).
The patient was resuscitated with four units of packed red blood cells and two liters of normal saline. Intravenous pantoprazole was administered. Surgery was consulted and a nasogastric tube was placed for gastric decompression. Small bowel enteroscopy discovered two nonbleeding superficial clean-based ulcers in the duodenum and an ulcerated jejunal mass, which appeared to be the source of bleeding. Biopsies from the mass showed an invasive, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Subsequently, exploratory laparotomy revealed additional masses in the ileum and transverse colon suspicious for malignancy; thus, partial small bowel and partial colonic resection with end colostomy and Hartmann’s pouch were performed. The mass in the jejunum measured 1.7 cm x 1 cm x 0.2 cm. Pathologic evaluation revealed invasive, poorly differentiated carcinoma with gland formation only in the lesion resected from jejunum (Figure ). Cytokeratin was immunoreactive (Figure ). CK7, CK20, TTF-1, LCA, CD56, synaptophysin, and chromogranin stains were negative. Regional resected lymph nodes and other resected lesions were devoid from cancer.

924,28,APACHE II Score,risk,integer,4,Synthetic,"A 72-year-old male with leukemia was brought to the hospital for urgent evaluation after experiencing several days of progressive fatigue, mild shortness of breath, and lower abdominal discomfort. He appeared mildly flushed on arrival, with a body temperature of 37.5°C and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Due to the concerning nature of his presentation, he was rapidly admitted to the intensive care unit and underwent prompt assessment. His initial blood pressure measurements showed systolic readings at 120 mm Hg and diastolic readings around 64 mm Hg. Further examination revealed that his heartbeat was regular, averaging approximately 88 beats per minute. He denied any recent episodes of confusion or altered sensorium, and his neurological evaluation was consistent with a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 that reflected full alertness. His arterial blood gas analysis indicated a pH of 7.42, suggesting no major acid-base disturbance at this time, although there remained a heightened concern for potential clinical changes given his risk profile. The fraction of inspired oxygen he required on admission was around 45%, and his measured partial pressure of oxygen was approximately 72 mm Hg, reported in the context of his ongoing respiratory complaints. Laboratory studies performed shortly after arrival showed a sodium concentration of 136 mEq/L and a potassium concentration of 4.3 mEq/L, which were within acceptable limits. However, his serum creatinine level was elevated at 1.8 mg/dL, necessitating careful monitoring of his renal function. Despite this elevated level, there was no immediate concern for acute kidney injury on top of this finding, and he did not manifest signs of significant fluid overload or severe acid-base derangements. His hematocrit was measured at 34%, which was slightly reduced but not acutely critical, and his white blood cell count reached around 12,800 per cubic millimeter, raising the possibility of an infectious or inflammatory process given his background and presenting symptoms. He maintained full orientation according to clinical observation, with preserved verbal and motor responses consistent with a normal level of alertness. Owing to the acuity of his presentation, he underwent an emergent exploratory procedure for a suspected intra-abdominal source of infection or complication, and he was closely observed in the postoperative and critical care setting because of his predisposition to severe infections. Prior medical history included issues that compromise his overall immune defense, so heightened surveillance and aggressive prophylactic measures were implemented. Throughout the initial hours after intervention, he received supportive care while monitoring his respiratory parameters and hemodynamic stability. Additional imaging was obtained to clarify the etiology of his symptoms, and cultures were taken to identify any possible pathogens. Discussion among the care team emphasized vigilance for potential complications, including careful fluid balance and reassessment of his renal parameters. As the hours progressed, he remained hemodynamically stable with no new signs of deteriorating consciousness, and his temperature remained near baseline without further fever spikes. Plans for ongoing management included tailored antimicrobial therapy once specific organisms were identified, potential adjustment of his oxygen requirements if his lung function changed, and continued evaluation of his creatinine level to ensure there was no worsening of renal status. Throughout his stay, detailed monitoring of his laboratory values and clinical status was prioritized, given his significant risk factors and the emergent nature of his presentation.",What is the patient's APACHE II score?,"{'History of severe organ failure or immunocompromise': True, 'age': [72, 'years'], 'Temperature': [37.5, 'degrees celsius'], 'pH': 7.42, 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [88, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [24, 'breaths per minute'], 'Sodium': [136, 'mEq/L'], 'Potassium': [4.3, 'mEq/L'], 'creatinine': [1.8, 'mg/dL'], 'Acute renal failure': False, 'Hematocrit': [34, '%'], 'White blood cell count': [12800, 'mm^3'], 'Glasgow Coma Score': 15, 'FiO2': [45, '%'], 'PaO2': [72, 'mm Hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [64, 'mm Hg'], 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [120, 'mm Hg'], 'Surgery Type': 'Emergency'}",12,12,12,"The criteria for the APACHE II Score are listed below:

The total APACHE II score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.
    
The patient's current APACHE II score is 0 points.
The patient is 72 years old. Because the patient's age is between 65 and 74, 5 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 5 = 5.
The patient is reported to have an organ failure of immunocompromise with a surgery type being classified as Emergency. The patient's surgery type is classified as 'Emergency' and so 5 points are added to the total, making the current total 5 + 5 = 10.
The patient's FiO2 percentage is 45%.
Because the patient's FiO₂ percentage is less than 50%, we need to examine the patient's partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's PaO₂ is 72 mm Hg. Because the patient's PaO₂ is greater than 70 mm Hg, we do not add any points to the total, keeping the current total at 10.
The patient's temperature is 37.5 degrees celsius. 
Because the patient's temperature is between 36 and 38.5 degrees celsius, no points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 10.
The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure) + 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 1/3 * 120 mm Hg + 2/3 * 64 mm Hg = 82.66667 mm Hg.
Hence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 82.66667 mm Hg.Because the patient's mean arterial pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The patient's heart rate is 88 beats per minute.
Because the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The patient's respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.
Because the patient's respiratory rate is between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The patient's pH is 7.42.
Because the patient's pH is between 7.33 and 7.49, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The concentration of sodium is 136 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 136 mEq. To convert from 136 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 136 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 136 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 136.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136 mEq sodium/L converts to 136.0 mmol sodium/L. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The concentration of potassium is 4.3 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of potassium from mEq to mmol. The mass of potassium is 4.3 mEq. To convert from 4.3 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 4.3 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 4.3 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 4.3 mmol potassium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.3 mEq potassium/L converts to 4.3 mmol potassium/L. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The concentration of creatinine is 1.8 mg/dL. The patient is determined to not have an acute renal failure.
The patient is determined to not have a chronic renal failure.
Because the patient's creatinine level is between 1.5 and 1.9 mg/dL (without acute renal failure), 2 points are added to the score, making the current total 10 + 2 = 12.
The patient has a hematocrit of 34%.
Because the patient's hematocrit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 12.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell count is 12800 count/mm^3. To convert 12800 count/mm^3 of white blood cell count to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 mm^3/L which will give 12800 white blood cell count count/mm^3 * 1000000.0 mm^3/L = 12800000000.0 white blood cell count count/L. Because the patient's white blood cell count is at least 3x10^9/L, but less than 15 x10^9/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 12.
The patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 15. For this criterion, we subtract 15 from the 15 points and add that to the total score. 15 - 15 = 0. Hence, we add 0 to the total making the current total 0 + 12 = 12.
Hence, the patient's APACHE II score is 12."
934,28,APACHE II Score,risk,integer,14,Synthetic,"A 74-year-old male was brought to the intensive care unit with a high fever, respiratory difficulty, and marked lethargy that raised immediate concerns about a serious ongoing process. He had a known vulnerability regarding his body’s defense mechanisms, placing him at risk for severe complications, and he had recently undergone an operative intervention that had been arranged in advance rather than on short notice, arriving in the ICU in the immediate postoperative period. His Glasgow Coma Score was calculated at 4. His family reported that he had been progressively more tired and confused over the previous day, culminating in an acute decline prompting emergency transport. Vital sign measurements at presentation showed a high body temperature of 39.2 °C, correlating with his flushed skin and possible infectious or inflammatory process. His pulse was recorded at about 89 beats per minute, relatively stable but concerning in the context of the other findings, and his respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute, reflecting an increased workload of breathing. Measurement of arterial pressures yielded a systolic reading of 128 mm Hg and diastolic of 71 mm Hg. Though these blood pressure indices did not indicate frank shock, they demanded close monitoring given his precarious clinical state. Blood tests drawn immediately revealed a serum sodium of 147 mEq/L and potassium of 4.8 mEq/L, suggesting that some electrolytes were at the higher end of normal ranges and warranting repeated checks to detect any further derangements. Of greater concern was the markedly elevated creatinine level measured at 2.6 mg/dL; this indicated a deterioration of renal function in the absence of any documented longstanding kidney disease. His hematocrit was reduced to 29 %, potentially reflecting either chronic anemia or an acute drop that might impair oxygen-carrying capacity and limit the body’s physiologic reserves. Further laboratory data showed that his total white blood cell population was around 10,400 cells/mm³, a mild elevation that could signal an infectious process or another inflammatory trigger. His arterial blood sample exhibited a pH of 7.46, suggesting a mild shift toward alkalinity or a compensated state that could change quickly depending on ongoing metabolic or respiratory stresses. On arrival, he was placed on a markedly increased FiO2 at 80 %, well above half of the inhaled air, to maintain adequate oxygenation. Despite this high supplemental oxygen, his calculated alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient was markedly elevated at about 220 mm Hg, indicating a significant impairment in gas exchange. Clinically, he appeared tachypneic and demonstrated labored inhalations, with accessory muscle recruitment evident on inspection. He had no documented history of chronically reduced kidney function, and conversations with relatives indicated that he had not faced kidney-related admissions in the past, suggesting a new onset for his current renal issue. Given his severe mental status changes, the team worried about the risk of airway compromise or inability to guard the airway should his neurologic function worsen. At the same time, care had to be taken to evaluate potential causes of his elevated temperature, which ranged beyond typical low-grade readings. Because of the level of sedation required to keep him comfortable and safe for further investigations, the team recognized the urgency in ruling out primary infections and other acute problems, particularly in light of his inherent predisposition to complications from infectious agents or organ insults. Plans were considered for imaging studies to identify possible sources of infection, bleeding, or other triggers for abrupt decompensation, while also evaluating for potential complications related to his recent surgery rather than planning any new operative procedure at that time. By the time he underwent initial laboratory and clinical evaluations, he remained in a state of severely impaired consciousness, and his breathing dynamics signaled the possibility of impending respiratory compromise if interventions were delayed. The clinical picture suggested a complex interplay of high fever, acute renal derangement, and disordered mentation, all superimposed on a background of increased susceptibility to severe illness. Ongoing discussions among the critical care team centered on stabilizing him hemodynamically, preventing further organ dysfunction, and determining whether additional operative management would be necessary after his recent elective procedure or whether more extensive stabilization measures needed to precede any further intervention. His condition at the bedside underscored the delicate balance of supporting his circulation, protecting against the risk of worsening kidney injury, and identifying any treatable source of fever. Despite the absence of a known chronic kidney process, the elevated creatinine on arrival emphasized the need for meticulous oversight, including repeated checks of his urine output and the potential for renal imaging if indicated.

The total APACHE II score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.
    
The patient's current APACHE II score is 0 points.
The patient is 74 years old. Because the patient's age is between 65 and 74, 5 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 5 = 5.
The patient is reported to have an organ failure of immunocompromise with a surgery type being classified as Elective. The patient's surgery type is classified as 'Elective' and so 2 points are added to the total, making the current total 5 + 2 = 7.
The patient's FiO2 percentage is 80%.
Because the patient's FiO₂ percentage is 50% or greater, we need to examine the A-a gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a gradient is 220. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 200 and 349, we add 2 points to the total, making the current total 7 + 2 = 9.
The patient's temperature is 39.2 degrees celsius. 
Because the patient's temperature is between 39 and 41 degrees celsius, 3 points are added to the score, making the current total, 9 + 3 = 12.
The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure) + 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 1/3 * 128 mm Hg + 2/3 * 71 mm Hg = 90.0 mm Hg.
Hence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 90.0 mm Hg.Because the patient's mean arterial pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 12.
The patient's heart rate is 89 beats per minute.
Because the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 12.
The patient's respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute.
Because the patient's respiratory rate is between 25 and 34 breaths per minute, 1 point is added to the score, making the current total, 12 + 1 = 13.
The patient's pH is 7.46.
Because the patient's pH is between 7.33 and 7.49, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 13.
The concentration of sodium is 147 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 147 mEq. To convert from 147 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 147 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 147 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 147.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 147 mEq sodium/L converts to 147.0 mmol sodium/L. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 13.
The concentration of potassium is 4.8 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of potassium from mEq to mmol. The mass of potassium is 4.8 mEq. To convert from 4.8 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 4.8 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 4.8 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 4.8 mmol potassium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.8 mEq potassium/L converts to 4.8 mmol potassium/L. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 13.
The concentration of creatinine is 2.6 mg/dL. The patient is determined to have an acute renal failure.
The patient is determined to not have a chronic renal failure.
Because the patient has acute renal failure and a creatinine level between 2.0 and 3.5, 6 points are added to the score, making the current total 13 + 6 = 19.
The patient has a hematocrit of 29%.
Because the patient's hematocrit is between 20% and 30%, 2 points are added to the score, making the current total 19 + 2 = 21.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell count is 10400 count/mm^3. To convert 10400 count/mm^3 of white blood cell count to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 mm^3/L which will give 10400 white blood cell count count/mm^3 * 1000000.0 mm^3/L = 10400000000.0 white blood cell count count/L. Because the patient's white blood cell count is at least 3x10^9/L, but less than 15 x10^9/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 21.
The patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 4. For this criterion, we subtract 15 from the 4 points and add that to the total score. 15 - 4 = 11. Hence, we add 11 to the total making the current total 11 + 21 = 32.
Hence, the patient's APACHE II score is 32."
931,28,APACHE II Score,risk,integer,11,Synthetic,"A 70-year-old individual with a known vulnerability that compromises the body’s defenses was transferred to the intensive care unit from the emergency department following several days of general malaise, reduced appetite, and progressive confusion. A formal assessment revealed a Glasgow Coma Score of 5. The initial temperature measurement was 36.8°C, suggesting that fever was not contributing to the presentation at that point, and cardiovascular assessments showed a systolic pressure of 124 mm Hg coupled with a diastolic pressure of 69 mm Hg. The heart rate registered at approximately 84 beats per minute, reflecting a relatively stable rhythm, and the respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute with unlabored breathing, indicating no overt signs of increased respiratory effort at that time. Laboratory values painted a picture of mild deviations, including a serum sodium level of 144 mEq/L and a serum potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L, both of which were within broadly acceptable limits. Some degree of renal insufficiency prompted concern, as the serum creatinine measured of 2.0 mg/dL, indicative of acute renal failure. Hematologic findings offered further insight, with the hematocrit close to 41% and a white blood cell count of 11,400 per cubic millimeter, hinting at a mild elevation suggestive of possible infection or inflammation. Additional investigation into the acid-base status showed an arterial pH of 7.43, implying near-normal balance in the absence of overt metabolic or respiratory derangements. By the time the arterial blood gas was analyzed, the individual was breathing under ambient conditions, so the fraction of inspired oxygen was only that found in room air at 21%. Despite the minimal external respiratory support, the arterial oxygen tension held steady at 75 mm Hg, which did not raise concern for significant gas-exchange impairment. Nonetheless, the patient’s dangerously decreased awareness level raised alarms, as the mental status evaluation suggested a pattern of profound disorientation and an inability to communicate consistently. This profound alteration was a striking feature, especially in a setting where defenses against infections or other stressors are suspected to be less robust than normal. Although the admission was prompted by concerns of rapid clinical decline in the context of immune vulnerability, there was no intention to undertake a procedure that involved opening a body cavity or relying on invasive operative strategies; rather, the approach at this juncture was to evaluate comprehensively for potential sources of deterioration, to stabilize organ function, and to ensure that any significant complications, whether infectious or inflammatory, were addressed immediately. Prior to this episode, the patient had not been known to have chronic dysfunction of the kidneys, and there were no records of frequent hemodialysis or an ongoing requirement for renal replacement therapies. Close neurological observation was carried out, considering the low responsiveness that placed the individual at a high risk for airway compromise and other complications unless carefully managed. Subsequent imaging studies, blood cultures, and specialist consultations were all under consideration as part of the initial workup. The decision to refrain from pursuing any invasive surgical route was based on the patient’s background, the lack of localizing signs that would point to a lesion needing operative intervention, and the immediate need to focus on controlling possible infection, ensuring stable hemodynamics, and improving the severely impaired level of consciousness. Throughout the assessment process, there was an emphasis on vigilant monitoring of vital signs, periodic reevaluation of the patient’s neuro status, and stringent hygienic measures to guard against hospital-acquired complications, especially given the compromised state of the immune system. All these findings reflected the patient’s baseline condition upon presentation, well before any targeted therapies or advanced interventions had been initiated, underscoring the importance of timely evaluation and ongoing supportive care for an individual whose physiologic reserves might be less capable of containing even minor insults without rapid deterioration.",What is the patient's APACHE II score?,"{'History of severe organ failure or immunocompromise': True, 'age': [70, 'years'], 'Temperature': [36.8, 'degrees celsius'], 'Mean arterial pressure': [83, 'mm Hg'], 'pH': 7.43, 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [84, 'beats per minute'], 'respiratory rate': [14, 'breaths per minute'], 'Sodium': [144, 'mEq/L'], 'Potassium': [4.6, 'mEq/L'], 'creatinine': [2.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Chronic renal failure': False, 'Hematocrit': [41, '%'], 'White blood cell count': [11400, 'mm^3'], 'Glasgow Coma Score': 5, 'FiO2': [21, '%'], 'PaO2': [75, 'mm Hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [69, 'mm Hg'], 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [124, 'mm Hg'], 'Surgery Type': 'Nonoperative', 'Acute renal failure': True}",26,26,26,"The criteria for the APACHE II Score are listed below:

The total APACHE II score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.
    
The patient's current APACHE II score is 0 points.
The patient is 70 years old. Because the patient's age is between 65 and 74, 5 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 5 = 5.
The patient is reported to have an organ failure of immunocompromise with a surgery type being classified as Nonoperative. The patient's surgery type is classified as 'Nonoperative' and so 5 points are added to the total, making the current total 5 + 5 = 10.
The patient's FiO2 percentage is 21%.
Because the patient's FiO₂ percentage is less than 50%, we need to examine the patient's partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's PaO₂ is 75 mm Hg. Because the patient's PaO₂ is greater than 70 mm Hg, we do not add any points to the total, keeping the current total at 10.
The patient's temperature is 36.8 degrees celsius. 
Because the patient's temperature is between 36 and 38.5 degrees celsius, no points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 10.
The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure) + 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 1/3 * 124 mm Hg + 2/3 * 69 mm Hg = 87.33333 mm Hg.
Hence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 87.33333 mm Hg.Because the patient's mean arterial pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The patient's heart rate is 84 beats per minute.
Because the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The patient's respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute.
Because the patient's respiratory rate is between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The patient's pH is 7.43.
Because the patient's pH is between 7.33 and 7.49, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The concentration of sodium is 144 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 144 mEq. To convert from 144 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 144 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 144 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 144.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 144 mEq sodium/L converts to 144.0 mmol sodium/L. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The concentration of potassium is 4.6 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of potassium from mEq to mmol. The mass of potassium is 4.6 mEq. To convert from 4.6 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 4.6 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 4.6 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 4.6 mmol potassium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.6 mEq potassium/L converts to 4.6 mmol potassium/L. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.
The concentration of creatinine is 2.0 mg/dL. The patient is determined to have an acute renal failure.
The patient is determined to not have a chronic renal failure.
Because the patient has acute renal failure and a creatinine level between 2.0 and 3.5, 6 points are added to the score, making the current total 10 + 6 = 16.
The patient has a hematocrit of 41%.
Because the patient's hematocrit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 16.
The patient's concentration of white blood cell count is 11400 count/mm^3. To convert 11400 count/mm^3 of white blood cell count to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 mm^3/L which will give 11400 white blood cell count count/mm^3 * 1000000.0 mm^3/L = 11400000000.0 white blood cell count count/L. Because the patient's white blood cell count is at least 3x10^9/L, but less than 15 x10^9/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 16.
The patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 5. For this criterion, we subtract 15 from the 5 points and add that to the total score. 15 - 5 = 10. Hence, we add 10 to the total making the current total 10 + 16 = 26.
Hence, the patient's APACHE II score is 26."
898,29,PSI Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP,severity,integer,18,Synthetic,"A 75-year-old female arrived at the emergency department describing four days of progressive respiratory discomfort that worsened considerably in the last 24 hours. She reported having felt slightly chilled on and off, yet only noted a mild elevation in her temperature when she checked it at home, which was confirmed on arrival as moderately above her usual baseline, though not strikingly high at 37.6 degrees Celsius. She indicated that her coughing, which began as an intermittent irritation, gradually intensified and was now accompanied by minimal sputum production. Though she did not appear confused or disoriented during the interview, she mentioned being more fatigued than usual, finding simple household activities taxing. She has resided independently for many years, taking care of her daily needs without ongoing assistance, and specifically noted living in her own house rather than a supervised environment. She claimed no further limitations except for occasionally reduced stamina related to a neurological event in her past, which she said caused transient weakness and difficulty with coordination several years earlier. According to her recollection, careful management and rehabilitation helped her regain much of her functionality, but she still routinely follows up with her physician to ensure there are no late complications. She also recalled a longstanding concern involving her liver that once led her to attend specialized evaluations, though she did not elaborate extensively on the details aside from stating that she has to be mindful of potential side effects when prescribed new medications. She denied significant cardiac difficulties that would require regular attention for fluid management and has experienced no episodes of fluid accumulation in her extremities or lungs that might point to a chronic heart condition; she insisted her heart rate fluctuations are typically mild. On examination, she was alert, cooperative, and oriented to time, place, and situation, with no lapse in her current mental clarity. Her breathing, however, caught the attention of the clinical team, given that her rate of inspirations was measured at 15 per minute, which was within an acceptable range but did not match the degree of subjective discomfort she reported. Her pulse was notably elevated at 105 beats per minute, though its rhythm was regular. Documentation of her systolic blood pressure revealed a value of 114 mm Hg, consistent with a mildly reduced level for her typical readings but not acutely alarming. Laboratory results obtained prior to any intervention provided further insight into her presentation. A test gauging her systemic acid-base status returned a reading of 7.32, suggesting a shift toward acidity that merited continued observation and possible additional studies to determine the cause. Her oxygenation status, measured in an arterial sample, showed a partial pressure of 74 mm Hg, which aligned with her subjective complaints of difficulty taking a full breath and feeling winded after minimal exertion. A renal function indicator remained within a reasonable range at 17 mg/dL, and she experienced no known deficits in her kidney output or filtration capacity, stating that her urine production and serum chemistry have generally stayed stable at her routine checkups. An electrolyte panel signaled that her serum sodium was on the higher end, with a measurement of 148 mEq/L, prompting the team to consider her hydration status and dietary intake. Additional labs revealed that her red blood cell concentration was at 50%, a figure that did not appear to compromise her oxygen-carrying capacity, and her serum glucose reading of 114 mg/dL appeared mildly above average but not indicative of a significant metabolic disturbance.nRadiographic imaging of her thorax displayed evidence of infection, along with a collection of fluid located around one lung field, which was consistent with the findings of dullness to percussion and altered breath sounds on physical examination. This fluid accumulation raised the possibility of complications related to her acute presentation, though she did not endorse any known chronic processes that typically result in recurrent fluid build-up in the pleural space. She recalled no abrupt changes to her usual patterns of activity besides progressive shortness of breath over the past several days, indicating that she continued performing the majority of her daily routines before feeling forced to seek medical attention for this escalating respiratory distress. She reiterated that she had no recent hospital admissions or major interventions, and her prior physician visits revolved around regular follow-up evaluations of her past neurological issue and intermittent monitoring of her liver status. Despite the significant respiratory findings, she did not exhibit confusion, speech difficulties, or notable lapses in memory during evaluation, steadily maintaining awareness of her situation. Given her advanced age and the multiple considerations posed by her past medical history, the clinical team determined that her symptoms, exam findings, and laboratory results warranted further in-hospital workup.

The total score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.

The current PSI score is 0.
The patient is 75 years old. We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 75 = 75.
Because the patient is female, we subtract 10 points from the current total, making the current total 75 - 10 = 65.
The patient is not a nursing home resident and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 65.
Neoplastic disease is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 65.
Liver disease history is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 20 points to the score, making the current total 65 + 20 = 85.
CHF History is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.
Cerebrovascular disease history is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 85 + 10 = 95.
Renal Disease History is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 95.
Altered Mental Status is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 95.
Pleural effusion on x-ray is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 95 + 10 = 105.
The patient's pulse is 105 beats per minute. The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 105.
The patient's temperature is 37.6 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 105.
The patient's pH is 7.32. The patient's pH is less than 7.35, and so we add 30 points to the score, making the current total 105 + 30 = 135.
The patient's respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 135.
The patient's systolic blood pressure is 114 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 135.
The concentration of BUN is 17 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 135.
The concentration of sodium is 148 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 148 mEq. To convert from 148 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 148 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 148 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 148.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148 mEq sodium/L converts to 148.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 135.
The concentration of glucose is 114 mg/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 135.
The patient's hematocrit is 50 %. The patient's hematocrit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 135.

895,29,PSI Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP,severity,integer,15,Synthetic,"A 67-year-old male arrived at the emergency department reporting several days of worsening cough, mounting fatigue, and a high fever that he first noted upon waking the previous morning. He stated that his cough, initially nonproductive with mild throat irritation, had evolved into a deeper, more distressing pattern over the last day or so, and he began to experience chills and consistent warmth to the touch. At presentation, he was alert and engaged, conversing readily without any signs of confusion or mental cloudiness. According to him, he lives independently in a single-story residence and has not required ongoing skilled care or around-the-clock supervision. He recalls a neurological event several years ago that temporarily affected his speech and coordination, though he says he eventually recovered with rehabilitative support. He also mentions that he has required periodic evaluations for a medical condition tied to certain aspects of his metabolism, though he reports having remained stable in recent times with no major flare-ups. Nevertheless, he became concerned when his current symptoms failed to improve with usual home measures such as rest and oral hydration. On evaluation, his core temperature was measured at 38.9 degrees Celsius, reflecting a significant fever consistent with the abrupt onset of his symptoms. Physical assessment showed that he was breathing at a rate of about 17 breaths per minute and maintaining a heart rate of approximately 100 beats per minute, which he acknowledged felt faster than normal for him when he attempted mild activity. His blood pressure was recorded as 135 mm Hg on the systolic reading, aligning with a stable circulatory status for someone of his age. He displayed no outward evidence of fluid accumulation in his lower extremities or jugular venous distension, and he denied any chest pain beyond the occasional discomfort from deep coughing. When asked about his general medical history, he stated he had been followed intermittently over the years for a significant but well-controlled liver-related condition, which had not necessitated recent hospital admissions. Initial laboratory results showed a mild disturbance in his acid-base balance, with a pH documented at 7.46, though his clinical examination did not suggest any overt respiratory or metabolic compromise. He was found to have a partial pressure of oxygen of 87 mm Hg on room air, confirming that his oxygen level was somewhat lower than desired for an individual without known chronic lung issues. Additional lab testing highlighted an elevated blood urea measurement of 31 mg/dL, raising suspicion that he might be experiencing increased protein breakdown or a reduced intravascular volume status, which could complicate recovery. His serum sodium concentration was noted to be 132 mEq/L, just below normal limits, which, in conjunction with his ongoing fever and reduced oral intake, could signify evolving electrolyte fluctuations. A hematocrit value of 33% indicated a borderline low red cell volume, though he reported no significant dizziness or lightheadedness beyond what he assumed stemmed from feeling feverish. His measured glucose of 128 mg/dL was slightly above his baseline, which he attributed to decreased appetite and occasional sugary sports drinks he consumed to stay hydrated when his cough worsened. Chest auscultation revealed coarse breath sounds over the right lateral lung fields, and imaging confirmed findings of inflammation and fluid layering within the thoracic cavity, consistent with a localized infectious process and excess fluid accumulation. Despite his evident infection and the presence of fluid in the pleural space, he remained oriented throughout the conversation, recounting details about his daily activities and stressing that he has never relied on institutional living arrangements. The team acknowledged that his prior neurological history and ongoing liver-related concerns, though not actively flaring, could affect his overall resilience. With that in mind, he was prepared for further evaluation and management directed at controlling his acute condition, including monitoring of his oxygen levels, repeating relevant laboratory analyses, and ensuring any unstable parameters were addressed without delay.",What is the patient's Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)?

883,29,PSI Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP,severity,integer,3,Synthetic,"A 68-year-old male presented to the emergency department after three days of progressive shortness of breath, productive cough, and generalized malaise. He noted an intermittent fever at home, which worsened on the day of admission, along with chills and night sweats. He has been feeling more fatigued than usual, struggling to complete his routine morning walks without pausing to catch his breath, and has also experienced mild chest tightness upon exertion. On initial evaluation, he was awake, alert, and oriented, conversing clearly without lapses in memory or concentration. He denied experiencing any acute episodes of unilateral weakness, facial droop, or slurred speech in the past, and he reported no longstanding liver problems. According to him, fluid overload symptoms such as progressive leg swelling, difficulty breathing while lying flat, or episodes of nighttime coughing have not been issues. He described a past difficulty with kidney function, requiring follow-up with specialists, and also revealed a remotest history of a malignant growth for which he received treatment several years ago. On further questioning, he stated that his usual medications include those needed to monitor both his chronic conditions and his past oncologic management, although he did not recall any medication specifically for significantly compromised cardiac output. He claimed that he has never been told he suffered from sudden neurologic attacks or blood supply problems to his brain and had not visited any facility for such concerns. He reported no sign of abdominal issues, and he had never been diagnosed with disorders that would impair liver enzymes or clotting factors. Recent activity levels have diminished because of his respiratory discomfort, which he first attributed to a seasonal change. However, with the escalation of his breathing difficulties and fever, he became worried. Despite staying hydrated, he felt persistently thirsty, and routine checks at home indicated elevated fingerstick readings, prompting him to mention prior abnormal glucose measurements to medical providers. On arrival, his vital signs showed a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg. His core temperature measured 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit, aligning with his complaint of fever. An arterial blood sample revealed a partial pressure of oxygen of 75 mm Hg, consistent with his labored breathing, and his serum chemistry was notable for a blood urea nitrogen level of 30 mg/dL. Further evaluation indicated that his serum sodium concentration was 136 mEq/L, and an arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.38. His hematocrit was 35%, suggesting a mild decrease in red blood cell concentration, and a random glucose test was 158 mg/dL, confirming the elevation he had suspected at home. Although he endorsed a history of kidney issues, he described meticulous monitoring of his fluid intake and ongoing consultations with specialists. He also confirmed that his previous cancer treatment had gone well, with no recent reactivations or complications, yet he undergoes periodic surveillance. There were no remarkable findings on examination that suggested significant fluid accumulation in his legs or lungs beyond what might be expected with an infection. He did not require continuous supplemental oxygen therapy at home, so the noted hypoxemia was new for him. Nonetheless, he remained conversational, followed commands appropriately, and displayed no confusion. The physical exam revealed inspiratory crackles over a focused region on one lung field, in keeping with his complaints of cough and breathlessness. After calmly recounting his symptoms and history, he awaited further imaging and laboratory assessment to clarify the etiology of his pneumonia and guide management.",What is the patient's Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)?

She was increasingly lethargic and was less interactive with family for 3 weeks before presentation. She also had urinary incontinence and gait instability for the same period.
Accompanying family reported a fall 3 weeks before admission with significant facial bruising. A computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast posttrauma was reported to have central nervous system (CNS) atherosclerosis with ventricular dilatation that was out of proportion to the degree of cortical atrophy []. A working diagnosis of NPH was made and she was scheduled to see a neurosurgeon for further management.
On admission, the patient had flat affect and poor cooperation. There was no papilledema. She was unable to follow commands for a complete neurological examination. Serum chemistry revealed sodium - 142 mmol/L, potassium - 2.9 mmol/L, HCO3 - 25 mmol/L, chloride - 102 mmol/L, glucose - 298 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen - 21 mg/dL, and creatinine - 0.7 mg/dL. Magnetic resonance scan of the brain revealed subtle debris layering the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles without restricted diffusion, consistent with either intraventricular hemorrhage or pus [Figures and ].
She was febrile to 103°F. Blood and respiratory cultures were obtained and she was started on a broad-spectrum coverage for possible meningitis. She developed diabetic ketoacidosis, which was addressed. She had two episodes of seizure-like activity. A lumbar puncture was initially deferred, whereas NPH had remained the most probable diagnosis, and the patient had a high international normalized ratio (INR). It was performed emergently following clinical deterioration, with development of fever.
The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected had increased protein, decreased glucose, and mononuclear pleocytosis. It was subjected to Gram-stain, which showed yeast and the species of the yeast were confirmed to be C. neoformans on culture. India ink preparation of the CSF was positive for Cryptococcus along with a positive cryptococcal antigen test. The patient was dozed with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B and oral flucytosine. HIV test was negative.

425,30,Serum Osmolality,lab test,decimal,pmc-7544303-1,Extracted,"We present the case of a 45-year-old gentleman, known diabetic for 6 years on metformin 1 g, twice a day, with reasonable control (hemoglobin A1c 6.4%). He was admitted to our emergency feeling unwell with 2 days’ history of vomiting and watery diarrhea, also associated crampy periumbilical pain. He denied a history of similar complaints in his companions, no change in his dietary habits preceding symptoms’ onset. He drinks alcohol occasionally; the last drink was 6 months before the presentation—no illicit drug use history. The initial vital signs were normal. Soon later, he became tachycardic with heart rate reaching 120 bpm, blood pressure 127/70 mmHg, and a normal temperature. He looked dehydrated; otherwise, his examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory workup was significant for initially low glucose 2.5 mmol/L (3.3–5.5 mmol/L), high serum creatinine 632 μmol/L (62–106 umol/L), and high blood urea nitrogen of 21 mmol/L (2.8–8 mmol/L). Serum electrolytes were as follows: potassium (K+) 6.3 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), sodium (NA) 144 mmol/L (135–145mmol/L), bicarbonate (HCO3) 5.8 mmol/L (23–29 mmol/L), and serum chloride 99 mmol/L (99–107 mmol/L). Serum aminotransferases were normal (ALT 31 U/L, AST 27 U/L). He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). Toxicology screening, including serum ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and urine for oxalate crystal, was negative.
Acidosis failed to respond to initial fluid hydration, including intravenous bicarbonate. Thus, the patient underwent 2 sessions of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (HD). After HD, his electrolyte disturbances improved, and intravenous fluid hydration continued. Acute kidney injury (AKI) workup, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, creatinine kinase level, and sepsis workup were unremarkable. Starting day 3, the patient was in a polyuric phase, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), producing between 3 and 6 L per day, and his serum creatinine was decreasing. He was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in good condition with a serum creatinine of 140 μmol/L (62–106 μmol/L). Figure shows serum creatinine trend during the hospitalization, Figure depicts serum lactic acid clearance during hospitalization.
Our patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI. Eventually, his prerenal insult led to acute tubular necrosis, as evident by the polyuric phase the patient exhibited on day three.",What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?

The concentration of sodium is 144.0 mmol/L. 
The concentration of bun is 21.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bun from mmol to mg. The mass of bun is 21.0 mmol. To convert 21.0 mmol of bun to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 21.0 mmol bun * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.021 mol bun. To convert from mol bun to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.021 mol bun * 28.02 g/mol = 0.58842 g bun. To convert 0.58842 g of bun to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.58842 g bun * 1000.0 mg/g = 588.42 mg bun. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 588.42 mg bun/10.0 dL = 58.842 mg bun/dL. The concentration value of 21.0 mmol bun/L converts to 58.842 mg bun/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 2.5 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 2.5 mmol. To convert 2.5 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 2.5 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.0025 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.0025 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 0.4504 g glucose. To convert 0.4504 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.4504 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 450.4 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 450.4 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 45.04 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 2.5 mmol glucose/L converts to 45.04 mg glucose/dL.

His medical history revealed having throat infection one month before admission. Complete blood count was within normal range for his age, as were his serum electrolytes. Blood examinations revealed an elevation of C-reactive protein and revealed both normal white blood cell and platelet counts. Serum IgA, C3 and C4 levels were all within normal limits and a urine examination also showed normal findings. Physical examination revealed mild proteinuria, hypertension and moderate anasarca (periorbital edema, ascites, and lower-extremity pitting edema). No medication and renal biopsy were performed because of the silent findings. However, two weeks later, after the admission for HSP, he complained of polydipsia and polyuria complaints and a physical examination revealed a 10-kg decrease in his baseline weight. There was no parental history of diabetes.

Skin turgor and tonus were also diminished. There were petechial rashes on his abdomen and lower extremities that progressed to nonblanchable macules (Figure ). He also had a fruity breath smell, dry mucous membranes, and tachypnea. Other examinations were normal. Laboratory studies yielded the following values (normal ranges were given in brackets): white blood cell count; 14.200/mm3 (6000–17500) with a normal differential formula; blood urea nitrogen, 9.34 mg/dL (5.7–20.1); serum creatinine, 0.6 mg/dL (0.1–0.9); albumin, 4.2 g/dL (3.5-5); sodium, 127 mmol/L (139–146); potassium, 4.51 mmol/ L (3.5–6.0); phosphorus, 2.8 mg/dL (4.9–7.9); and glucose, 27.83 mmol/L (3.3–5.0). Arterial blood gas values showed a pH of 7.10 (7.35–7.45); and bicarbonate: 8.4 mmol/L (21–28). Urine and serum ketones were positive. Urinalysis showed glycosuria. HbA1c was 11.7% (4.2-6.4). C-peptid level was 0.7 ng/mL (1.1-3.2). Insulin level was 4.28 μIU/mL (1.9-23). Autoantibodies including insulin, islet cell, glutamic acid decarboxylase were negative. Thyroid function tests were normal. Prothrombine time and partial thromboplastin time, immunoglobulin A, complement proteins C3 and C4, anti-DNA, antinuclear antibodies, and ASO levels were normal, as were serological tests for EBV and TORCH. Serum antigliadin and anti-endomysium antibodies were negative for the diagnosis of Celiac disease. Occult blood test in stool, urine and throat cultures were negative. The diagnosis of type 1 DM which presented with diabetic ketoacidosis accompanied by HSP was clinically made. A bolus of normal saline (20 mL/kg) was given intravenously, after which intravenous fluids were continued.

441,31,HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance),lab test,decimal,pmc-6167688-1,Synthetic,"A 44-year-old male was emergently admitted to our hospital because of hematemesis due to the rupture of gastroesophageal varices. Prior to admission, he had no remarkable medical history. There was no family history of liver diseases. He was not a habitual drinker and did not take other drugs. Two years before admission, his height was 172.2 cm, his body weight was 120.1 kg, and his BMI was 40.5. On admission, his body weight was 116.7 kg and his BMI was 39.4. Physical examination demonstrated mild anemia in the palpebral conjunctiva and hepatosplenomegaly in the abdomen. Neurological findings were not remarkable. Laboratory data are shown in Table . White blood cell count was increased (15,100/µL), and platelet count was within normal limits (18.3 × 104/µL), while hemoglobin was 7.0 g/dL due to bleeding. Biochemical examination showed serum total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, albumin 2.9 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 19 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 18 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 135 U/L, and gamma-glutamic transpeptidase 65 U/L, respectively. C-reactive protein was slightly elevated (1.33 mg/dL). Hyaluronic acid (187 ng/mL), type 4 collagen (248 ng/mL), and Mac2-binding protein (2.71 COI) were increased. Aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) [] and fibrosis-4 (FIB4) index [] were not elevated (APRI = 0.346 and FIB4 index = 1.08, respectively). APRI and FIB4 were calculated according to the following formula; APRI = AST level (IU/L) / upper limit of normal AST × 100 / platelet count (109/L), and FIB4 = age (year) × AST (IU/L) / {platelet count (109/L) × [ALT (U/L)]1/2}. Serum ferritin and ceruloplasmin were within normal limits. Hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core antibody, and hepatitis C virus antibody were all negative. Antinuclear antibody was elevated (×160), whereas antimitochondrial antibody and antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibody were negative. Immunoglobulins, including IgG, IgM, and IgA, were within normal limits. Coagulation tests revealed a decrease in the percentage of prothrombin time (53.6%). Hemoglobin A1c was 8.1%, glycoalbumin was 16.7%, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was 298 mg/dL, immunoreactive insulin (IRI) was 14.5 μIU/mL. Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) was 0.28. The QUICKI was a novel and accurate method for determining insulin resistance; QUICKI = 1 / (log fasting IRI [μU/mL] + log FPG [mg/dL]) []. Abdominal ultrasonography examination showed brightness, mild hepatorenal echo contrast, surface irregularity, dullness of the edge of the liver, and splenomegaly (Fig. –c). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated enlargement of the left hepatic lobe and splenomegaly, which corresponded to liver cirrhosis (Fig. ). Active contrast material extravasation was also seen, which represented active bleeding from gastroesophageal varices (Fig. , f). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed gastroesophageal varices (Fig. , h). White plug, which seemed to be the bleeding lesion, was also seen in gastric varices (Fig. ). The varices were treated by endoscopic injection sclerotherapy and endoscopic variceal ligation. The histological findings of liver biopsy were mild steatosis, mild chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate, and severe fibrosis in the expanded portal areas with bridging fibrosis and spotty or focal necrosis (Fig. –d). Vacuolation of the nucleus (Fig. ) and MDBs (Fig. ) were also seen. Immunostaining using anti-p62/SQSTM1 antibody (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan) demonstrated MDBs, which were irregularly shaped cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. , d) typically located in proximity to the nucleus (Fig. arrows). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis due to NASH. He was also diagnosed, for the first time, with T2DM based on the following findings: FPG exceeding 126 mg/dL, random glucose level over 200 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c over 6.5%. Because hyperglycemia persisted after admission, we started insulin therapy. After starting insulin treatment, hyperglycemia immediately improved.

456,31,HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance),lab test,decimal,14,Synthetic,"A 56-year-old male arrived at the clinic reporting persistent fatigue for several weeks, along with an unsettling increase in thirst that he typically notices mid-morning and again before bedtime. He attributes part of his low energy to an increasingly sedentary work schedule, which often involves spending long hours at a desk with minimal breaks for movement. He has also observed a gradual but continuous rise in his waist circumference over the past few years, attributing it partially to irregular eating habits that have included late-night snacks and an overreliance on convenience meals. Upon questioning, he discloses that his sleep has been less restful lately, with occasional awakenings in the early morning to drink water. He denies any episodes of severe dizziness or loss of consciousness but describes a mild lightheaded sensation if he goes too long without eating. Despite these concerns, he has not adhered to any formal exercise routine, aside from occasional brief walks when time permits, and acknowledges feeling easily winded when climbing stairs. He recalls that a family member had struggled with elevated blood sugar later in life, which raises concerns for him about the possibility of hereditary predisposition. On physical examination, he appears slightly overweight, with weight distribution favoring his abdominal area. Blood pressure readings on multiple occasions fall into the upper range of normal, though not definitively hypertensive, and his heart rate is stable. No visible abnormalities are noted in his skin or extremities, and palpation does not reveal edema or unusual swelling. Cardiac auscultation is benign, and pulmonary examination confirms clear air movement without adventitious sounds. He denies any chronic joint pain beyond mild knee aches he attributes to lack of regular activity, nor has he had previous hospitalizations. He admits to occasional late-night snacking on sweet foods and some reliance on caffeinated beverages during his workday. While he has attempted to modify his habits in the past by minimizing soda and candy consumption, he concedes that these efforts have not been sustained. Laboratory studies were collected in the early morning, after an overnight fast, and before any intervention or dietary guidance was initiated. These tests revealed a fasting sugar measurement of 130 mg/dL, indicating that his glucose regulation may be compromised. Additionally, a separate test showed that his insulin was 17 µIU/mL at the same fasting assessment. Other laboratory results demonstrate borderline elevations in certain lipids, although his renal parameters are within acceptable ranges, and he reports no known liver-related issues. He expresses concern that these findings, coupled with his family history of glucose irregularities, could signify an early manifestation of a more substantial metabolic disturbance. He does not currently take any prescriptions aimed at glycemic control and has no history of using herbal remedies that could influence his metabolism, aside from occasional over-the-counter anti-inflammatories for muscle soreness. He states a clear intent to explore dietary adjustments, such as increasing high-fiber vegetables and moderating his intake of refined carbohydrates, to see if these modifications help mitigate his symptoms. He seems open to gradually incorporating a more structured exercise regimen, though he worries about how his professional obligations and occasional fatigue might interfere with a consistent routine. The plan moving forward includes more frequent follow-up appointments to track his progress, monitor his weight, and re-evaluate his laboratory tests. He shows a motivated attitude toward preventing further metabolic derangements and expresses relief that his concerns are being addressed before more serious complications develop. At this point, he has not commenced any specific glucose-lowering agents, as his healthcare team intends to gather additional information and carefully assess the practicality of lifestyle interventions prior to considering pharmacological options.",What is the patient's HOMA-IR score?

She noted feeling more sluggish in the mornings and occasionally after meals, as well as experiencing minor tingling in her feet that concerned her, given several relatives had developed problems with blood sugar regulation later in life. She described her diet as moderately high in carbohydrates, often including sweetened beverages and refined grains, though she seldom monitored her intake in detail. She also reported a gradual increase in weight over the last two years, despite attempts to walk regularly in her neighborhood. Her mother had been diagnosed with an endocrine disorder characterized by elevated glucose levels, and her older sister suffered from similar metabolic challenges. During the patient’s examination, her vital signs were subtly notable for mild elevations in heart rate, although her blood pressure was only marginally above the upper limit of normal, and she denied any persistent headaches or visual changes. On inspection, she was found to have patches of darker, velvety skin on her posterior neck, raising a concern for insulin-related issues. Her waist circumference was increased beyond the recommended threshold for her height, suggesting that central adiposity had become a significant risk factor for metabolic compromise. She stated that she did not routinely check her blood sugar at home, but she felt thirstier than usual in recent months, occasionally waking up at night to sip water. She described no major changes in urinary frequency, though she admitted not always paying close attention to subtle patterns. Routine laboratory tests were ordered to evaluate her metabolic status. At the time of presentation, her fasting blood sugar measurement was 95 mg/dL with an insulin concentration of 8 µIU/mL. No prior pharmacologic therapy had been implemented for glycemic control, and she had only intermittently taken over-the-counter weight-loss supplements with minimal benefit. Her lipid profile from the same blood draw hinted at borderline imbalances, particularly in her triglycerides, though her total cholesterol remained reasonable. Her thyroid function tests were within normal limits, ruling out a primary thyroid disease contribution to her symptoms. She complained of generalized fatigue but did not exhibit significant muscle weakness on physical exam. She denied chest pain, palpitations, or a history of exertional dyspnea, though she did note occasional mild edema around her ankles after prolonged standing. On further discussion, she acknowledged rarely making dietary modifications beyond reducing portion sizes and had not enrolled in any structured exercise program due to time constraints. She expressed concern about her family history and worried that her early manifestations might eventually mirror those of her relatives. Based on the clinical assessment and the laboratory findings, it was determined that she exhibited risk factors for developing issues typically associated with imbalances in how the body handles glucose and the hormone involved in its regulation. Potential management strategies were discussed, but at this stage, no specialized pharmacologic therapy had been initiated. She was encouraged to pursue additional lifestyle adjustments and regular follow-up appointments to track and possibly stabilize her metabolic parameters before more overt complications could develop. The patient was amenable to increasing her daily walks, focusing on consistent dietary changes, and monitoring her weights at home. Further evaluation would assess whether she might require more rigorous interventions if her marker levels or her symptoms were to worsen over time.",What is the patient's HOMA-IR score?

On admission, her general appearance was acutely ill and generally edematous. A physical examination revealed that her blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, her heart rate was 90/min, her respiratory rate was 22/min, and her body temperature was 36.5℃. Her breathing sounds were clear, and her heartbeat was regular without murmur. A subsequent examination of her lower limbs showed asymmetric bilateral pretibial pitting edema predominantly in the left lower limb. In contrast, the right lower limb was less edematous and had very weak popliteal and pedal pulses. Delayed capillary refilling was also found in the right toes. The Homan's sign was negative.
Serum laboratory findings at admission were as follows: white blood cell count of 5,300/mm3, hematocrit of 39.5% with hemoglobin of 13.1 g/dl, and platelet count of 286,000/mm3. The serum sodium concentration was 141 mEq/L, the potassium concentration was 4.1 mEq/L, the chloride concentration was 104 mEq/L, and total CO2 was 28 mEq/L. The blood urea nitrogen concentration was 12.1 mg/dl, the creatinine concentration was 0.86 mg/dl, the serum total protein concentration was 4.3 g/dl, the albumin concentration was 2.2 g/dl, the total cholesterol concentration was 349.4 mg/dl, the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was 214.4 mg/dl, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was 111 mg/dl, and the triglyceride concentration was 120.1 mg/dl. The results of liver function tests were normal. The coagulation profile showed an activated partial thromboplastin time of 32.0 s, prothrombin time of 9.7 s, anti-thrombin III value of 82% (70-120%), protein C activity of 143% (70-130%), and protein S activity of 65% (58.7-119.2%). The anti-nuclear antibody titer was less than 1:40, the anti-double-stranded DNA titer was 30.9 IU/ml, the C3 level was 158 mg/dl, and the C4 level was 19 mg/dl. Anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin G, anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin M, and lupus anticoagulant were all negative. Urinalysis revealed 3+ proteinuria (spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 10.9 g/g creatinine; spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 7,406.2 mg/g creatinine) and trace hematuria (1-3 red blood cells/high-power field). To investigate the etiology of nephrotic syndrome, an urgent renal biopsy was performed.
Thereafter, although she had no risk factors for thrombosis such as immobilization, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, morbid obesity, or a recent orthopedic or gynecologic surgery, to rule out arterial thrombosis of the right lower extremity, lower extremity computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed. The CT imaging revealed that the right superficial femoral artery was occluded and there was no identifiable proximal source of thromboembolism in other large arteries (). On the basis of these CT angiographic findings, right lower extremity angiography was performed, which revealed a total occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery (). For the treatment of this condition, balloon dilatation was initially tried at the distal superficial femoral artery but failed. Hence, thrombectomy was performed with the Fogarty balloon catheter and the thrombi were successfully aspirated. After the interventional treatment, a good distal arterial flow was reestablished (). Thereafter, warfarin (5 mg/day) as an anticoagulant and corticosteroid treatments were initiated.
Subsequent transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic studies showed no evidence of intracardiac thrombus, vegetation, or other structural abnormalities including patent foramen ovale. Quantitation of proteinuria was confirmed by using a 24-hour urine collection that showed 10.2 g/day of protein excretion and 7.8 g/day of albumin excretion, respectively. Afterwards, with administration of warfarin and corticosteroid, the patient had nearly completely recovered from the edema and claudication and was discharged.

The patient did not show any symptoms. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed dissection from the CA (), DPA, and splenic artery (SA). This aneurysm was not seen on an abdominal unenhanced CT taken 6 years ago in a medical check-up. The enhancing inner lumen of the DPA was derived from false lumen and that of the SA was derived from true lumen. The stenosis of proximal side of SA, an aneurysm measuring 2.5 cm on DPAA with unenhanced mural thrombus, and the connection of the distal side of the DPAA to transverse pancreatic artery (TPA) with stenotic change were confirmed (). A connection with DPA and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was undetermined. The current diagnosis was the dissection of the CA to DPA and SA, resulting in DPAA and SA stenosis. After the diagnosis was made, the patient was referred to the department of radiology by a vascular surgeon for the consultation of endovascular surgery to prevent aneurysm rupture because open surgery was thought to be quite invasive as it required distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and CA repair. He had received medications for hypertension. There were no remarkable findings in his initial laboratory data. We planned to embolize DPAA, SA, and dissected area of CA that allow to preserve vascular supply to hepatic artery from SMA via peripancreatic arcade and to distal side of SA via gastroduodenal artery (GDA) to TPA. An angiography from the CA revealed the enhancing inner lumen of DPAA from false lumen of dissected CA connecting to TPA (). TPA was revealed between the peripancreatic arcade from GDA and pancreatic tail artery that connected to the distal side of SA. A 4.5 Fr. Shepherd hook–type guiding sheath (Parent Plus 45: Medikit, Tokyo, Japan), carrying a triple coaxial system, consisted of a 4 Fr. intermediate catheter (Cerulean G: Medikit, Tokyo, Japan), 2.6 Fr. high-flow catheter (Masters HF: Asahi Intech, Aichi, Japan), 1.9 Fr. microcatheter (Carnelian Marvel: Tokai Medical Products, Aichi, Japan), was hooked on the CA. To prevent the coil migration into the TPA, a microballoon catheter (Logos: Piolax, Yokohama, Japan) was advanced to the distal side of the DPAA via the GDA to pancreatoduodenal artery and inflated at the sufficient point of the TPA through the additional 4 Fr. shepherd hook catheter placed in the CA from the contralateral groin site (). The 4.5 Fr guiding sheath and the 4 Fr. Shepherd hook catheter were inserted from the right and left side of the common femoral artery, respectively. Under microballoon catheter inflation, the distal side of the DPAA was embolized with detachable coils (PRESIDIO 6 mm × 20 cm, GALAXY 6 mm × 15 cm) through a 1.9 Fr microcatheter (). Afterward, the microballoon catheter was deflated. Then, intra-aneurysmal coil embolization was performed with detachable coils (Interlock-35 10 mm × 40 cm, 2 of 8 mm × 40 cm, 6 mm × 20 cm) through the 4 Fr. intermediate catheter (). Later, the microcatheter in the intermediate catheter was carefully advanced through the dissected portion of the SA and embolization of the affected area was performed with detachable coils (Penumbra POD 6 mm × 50 cm, Penumbra 6 mm × 15 cm, 4 mm × 8 cm, GALAXY 2 of 7 mm × 21 cm, 2 of 4 mm × 15 cm) (). Finally, coil embolization of the dissected CA was performed using detachable coils (Interlock-35 10 mm × 40 cm, 2 of 8 mm × 40 cm, 6 mm × 10 cm, 4 mm × 10 cm, 6 mm × 10 cm, Penumbra coil 400 2 of 10 mm × 30 cm) (). The final angiography from SMA after pulling out all the systems revealed complete occlusion of the DPAA, the proximal side of SA, preserving GDA to the TPA to the distal side of SA and preserving GDA to common hepatic artery to left gastric artery (). No complication including post-coiling ischemia or transient laboratory abnormalities in transaminases, amylases, or lipase was observed during and after the endovascular surgery.

468,32,Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI),risk,integer,pmc-7263708-1,Extracted,"A 68-year-old non-smoking Caucasian man initially transferred from a different hospital for evaluation of a brain lesion found on imaging. The patient has a medical history pertinent to BPH, and his family history was relevant for a father with colon cancer.
Six months earlier, his primary care physician (PCP) evaluated him for worsening urinary symptoms and subsequently referred him to a urologist. Upon further evaluation, his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was normal at 3 ng/mL, and his digital rectal examination was normal, for which a cystoscopy with prostate GreenLight™ (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) enucleation was performed for BPH diagnosis. Five months later and one month before this admission, he discerned progressive worsening of double vision. His PCP examined and referred him to an ophthalmologist, who diagnosed him with third cranial (oculomotor) and sixth cranial (abducens) nerve palsy, which was subsequently confirmed by a neurologist.
Subsequently, the patient was admitted to the other hospital, and upon admission, he was found to have an acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperkalemia. Laboratory studies showed white blood cells of 27 x 10^3/µL, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 201 K/µL. His chemistry was pertinent for sodium of 134 mmol/L, potassium of 6.5 mmol/L, chloride of 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate level of 10 mmol/L, a glucose of 159 mg/dL, creatinine of 13 mg/dL, uric acid of 19.6 µmol/L, chromogranin A of 656 µg/L, and PSA of 22.67 ng/mL. He received hemodialysis and underwent bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy, after which his AKI resolved. An abdominal CT scan showed findings consistent with diffuse metastatic disease to the lungs, liver, and peritoneum, and brain MRI showed brain lesions. Therefore, he was, subsequently, transferred to our hospital for further care.
Upon evaluation in our hospital, imaging showed findings consistent with earlier recognized lesions at the other hospital (Figures -). The patient was, therefore, seen by a multidisciplinary team of a neurosurgeon, an ophthalmologist, a medical oncologist, and a radiation oncologist. Biopsies of a perirectal mass showed a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor. The oncologist who saw him diagnosed him with metastatic SCC of the lung; therefore, he was started on one cycle of carboplatin/etoposide chemotherapy during his hospitalization, which he tolerated well and was discharged home.
A senior oncologist saw the patient, reviewed all his radiographic images, and questioned the initial diagnosis of lung SCC based on the patient’s clinical presentation of urinary obstruction, hydronephrosis, and AKI. Hence, the original tumor location speculated to be consistent with a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor/SCC originating from the urinary tract. The senior oncologist, therefore, advised cystoscopy for prostate biopsy, which was declined by consulting urologist because the “prostate exam was normal.” Consequently, the senior oncologist sent the patient to a second urologist who performed cystoscopy and informed the patient that everything was normal. The senior oncologist had a thorough discussion to explain the necessity of a meticulous endoscopic urethral examination and prostate biopsy. Subsequently, the patient took the senior oncologist’s advice, went back to the urologist, and underwent a repeat diagnostic cystoscopy. This time, biopsies of the urethra were taken and confirmed a high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. 
 
The tissue specimen from this case was compared to the patient’s previous perirectal mass biopsy and was found to have similar features. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains were negative for CK7, CK20, PSA, and prostate-specific acid phosphatase. Scattered individual cells were positive for nuclear NKX 3.1 and cytoplasmic CK5. Moreover, there was diffuse variable positivity for nuclear p63 with greater than 80% of nuclei were positive for p53 and diffuse strong positivity for CD56, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and synaptophysin (Figure ).
Based on the clinical history of disease distribution, the pathologist considered the neoplasm to be likely of either prostate or urinary bladder origin. Subsequently, the senior oncologist reviewed the urethral biopsy, remained suspecting the primary site of cancer to be originating from the prostate. Therefore, he advised for prostate biopsy. Finally, the patient underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, which confirmed that all 12 cores were positive for prostate SCC (Figure ). The pathology findings confirmed the senior oncologist’s initial surmise that the metastatic cancer origin was from the genitourinary tract, likely involving prostate extending into the urethra.",What is the patient's Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)?

The abdominal examination revealed splenomegaly without tenderness. Other physical examinations were unremarkable. The result of complete blood count (CBC) showed 15,600/μL leucocytes with 38% polymorphonuclears and 57% lymphocytes. The peripheral blood smear displayed 37% of atypical lymphocytosis without any blast cells. The liver function tests were within normal limits. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 90 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 127 mg/L. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of COVID-19 was negative. The blood culture was negative.
The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis (IM). Acute EBV infection was confirmed by the positive IgM viral capsid Ag (VCA Ag). The patient's abdominal sonography showed splenomegaly.
Due to the severity of the patient's dysphagia and the high risk of upper airway obstruction, he received intravenous (IV) dexamethasone 8 mg twice a day. His condition improved partially after three days and was discharged from the hospital with oral prednisolone 30 mg/day.
Two days after discharge, the patient returned with high-grade fever, throat pain worsening, and dysphagia. Pharyngeal examination showed erythema and bilateral tonsillar swelling with whitish exudate. The ESR was 85 mm/hr.

978,36,Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005),risk,integer,18,Synthetic,"A 63-year-old male comes to the clinic for a preoperative evaluation in anticipation of a minimally invasive procedure on his knee, which has exhibited recurrent stiffness and discomfort ever since he resumed activity following a substantial abdominal operation he underwent several weeks ago. According to his recollection, the earlier operation required an extensive incision and a prolonged stay in the hospital for monitoring, during which he eventually recovered enough to be discharged home with instructions to gradually increase his physical activity. However, soon after returning home, he developed signs of a recent lung infection manifested by fever, productive coughing, and shortness of breath, ultimately requiring prompt intervention with antimicrobial therapy. He states that once the respiratory symptoms resolved, he attempted to resume a more normal routine, reporting that he feels able to rise from a seated position, walk around his home, and climb short flights of stairs without undue restriction or dependence on assistive devices. Despite this relative return to mobility, he has lately noted swelling in both of his lower extremities, particularly around late afternoon or evening, when the calves appear mildly puffy and retain indentations if pressed with a finger. He emphasizes that he has never before observed this kind of persistent lower-limb swelling and wonders whether his recent prolonged inactivity during hospitalization contributed to fluid retention. He has no history of twisted superficial vessels along his legs, denies any prior blockages in deep veins or breathing issues due to clots traveling to his lungs, and mentions that none of his close relatives have reported significant benefits or injuries related to irregular blood clotting. He likewise acknowledges no history of severe infections in the bloodstream or any widespread injury that would have confined him to bed for an extended period aside from his recent recovery period. With regard to fractures, he underscores that he has not experienced any broken bones in his hips or legs in modern memory, nor has he faced neurological complications leading to sudden paralysis. In discussing other conditions, he states he has never been diagnosed with an ongoing inflammatory disorder affecting his intestines, has not encountered an episode of reduced blood flow to his heart muscle requiring urgent cardiology intervention, and remains free of chronic lung conditions that would necessitate daily inhaled therapies. He also clarifies that he has had no formal diagnosis of any type of tumor or malignancy, and routine health screenings have consistently shown no evidence of suspicious growths. In terms of laboratory findings, he reports that previous assessments have never revealed any abnormalities regarding specific factors involved in thrombosis or unusual markers that might predispose him to bleeding or clot formation, and he has never been advised to discontinue certain medications because of platelet-related complications. On current examination, he appears stable, with normal heart and lung sounds on auscultation and no acute distress, though mild bilateral edema is evident below the knees. He expresses particular concern about this swelling since it is a new development, but he remains intent on proceeding with his planned procedure, which will be carried out via small incisions to visualize and address an ongoing structural issue in the affected knee. Overall, he exhibits optimism that correcting the joint problem through careful surgical intervention will restore more consistent functionality to his leg and, in turn, allow him to better manage daily activities without the setbacks he has faced since his recent hospitalization.",What is the patient's Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism?

972,36,Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005),risk,integer,12,Synthetic,"A 68-year-old female arrives for evaluation in advance of a small-scale surgical procedure intended to address a superficial skin lesion on her lower leg. She reports that this intervention is scheduled following a period of significant inactivity, as she has been spending nearly all of her time in bed for the past several days due to episodes of fatigue and intermittent discomfort in her limbs. She notes that she has required help with even basic mobility tasks, rarely walking beyond short distances within her home. On direct questioning, she explains that she has observed an unusual degree of swelling in both of her lower legs recently, describing how they seem to retain fluid by evening and occasionally feel tight when she tries to stand upright. She recalls no prior diagnosis of similar leg problems, other than periodic mild fluid retention in years past that typically resolved with rest and elevation. She emphasizes that, in spite of this new swelling, she has never experienced clotting events in her veins or lungs, and she denies undergoing imaging for suspect blockages in her circulation at any point. When asked about personal heart-related complications, she admits having encountered a sudden event several weeks ago that led to hospital care for reduced blood flow to a critical area of her heart muscle. Care providers used intravenous agents and close monitoring, after which her chest pain subsided, leaving her with instructions to adhere to a medication regimen and limit strenuous activity to aid in recovery. She has since followed that guidance, although she expresses concern that prolonged inactivity has contributed to her escalating leg swelling and general deconditioning. Regarding familial medical history, she remarks that at least one close relative experienced a significant venous obstruction in the past, which prompted evaluation for inherited clotting tendencies in family members. She was personally tested for certain known deficiencies but was told that the results did not reveal any specific genetic anomaly directly implicated in abnormal blood clot formation. She has not undergone any recent abdominal or orthopedic operations of major scope, and she denies receiving invasive vascular lines that remain in place for extended durations. She further indicates that she has never been informed of a deficient enzyme level or encountered unusual antibodies that would predispose her to circulatory complications. She likewise denies having encountered a sudden reduction in platelets in response to common intravenous therapies, and she states no physician has ever suggested that she harbors any obscure tendencies toward excessive coagulation or problematic bleeding. She clarifies that her bowel habits are largely stable and that she has not been diagnosed with an ongoing inflammatory condition of the intestines. She also notes that her breathing is stable in most situations, except when climbing stairs too quickly, and she has not been prescribed regular inhaled medications for any chronic lung disease. She reports no prior or current diagnosis of a malignant process and has not undergone treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. On examination, she appears alert but fatigued, with both calves showing pitting edema that worsens when she dangles her legs off the bed. Auscultation of her heart and lungs reveals no acute abnormality, and her superficial skin lesion has minimal redness with no overt signs of local infection. She remains hemodynamically stable, without fever, and her laboratory results do not point to any stark abnormality in blood counts or basic metabolic indices. She is hopeful that by proceeding with this minor intervention, she can avoid further complications while also addressing the lesion that has been giving her discomfort. She acknowledges that her extended bed rest has limited her physical conditioning, and she intends to follow recommended protocols to ensure proper circulation and minimize the likelihood of adverse events as she recovers fully from her recent cardiac issue. Despite her current challenges, she appears motivated to resume more regular activity and minimize further setbacks once her doctors clear her for routine ambulation and progressive exercise.",What is the patient's Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism?

She reports that this operation has been scheduled due to her chronic epigastric discomfort and a concern for possible adhesions from prior treatments, though she clarifies she has not undergone any substantial open interventions or larger-scale procedures in the recent month. She describes having been in reasonable health overall and denies any new-onset cardiac symptoms or troublesome changes in breathing during this time; in fact, she recalls completing her usual daily activities without limitation, including light exercise and regular household tasks. She shares that she has no recent history of persistent cough, fever, or respiratory compromise that might suggest a lingering lung-related illness. Furthermore, she has not experienced significant limb swelling or tightness, and her legs appear free of external abnormalities on inspection, which aligns with her lack of complaints regarding lower extremity heaviness or superficial venous concerns. She explains that she is able to move about readily, indicating a normal level of physical function for her age, as she lives independently, navigates stairs without assistance, and usually walks for mild exercise. Although she does not require assistive devices, she acknowledges a slight decrease in her stamina that she attributes to general stress and intermittent pains in the upper abdomen that led to her planned laparoscopic procedure. She denies having been diagnosed with occlusive clots in the legs or the lungs in the past, stating she has never been placed on extended courses of anticoagulant medication nor been hospitalized for vascular blockages. However, she mentions that a blood relative suffered a serious clotting event earlier in life, which makes her somewhat cautious about her own risk profile. She recalls discreet discussions with her healthcare providers in previous years, during which she was tested for known genetic contributors to excessive clotting, although those screenings did not highlight any specific worrisome mutations at the time. Still, she remains attentive to possible signs of circulatory problems, given her family’s unexpected experience. With respect to her broader medical background, she acknowledges that she was once diagnosed with a malignant process, for which she received appropriate therapy and follow-up. According to her account, she remains under regular surveillance to ensure no recurrence of that disease, and her most recent evaluations have not flagged any concerning developments. She also reports no recent difficulties pointing toward heart dysfunction, such as fluid retention, changes in exercise tolerance, or prominent orthopnea, and she emphasizes that her current ability to climb stairs and walk moderate distances without shortness of breath reassures her about her cardiac status. She denies involvement in any major accident or incurring extensive injuries that might confine her to bed for an extended period, and explicitly states she has not endured repeated trauma incidents or undergone any rigorous bone repairs in recent weeks. Her daily vital sign recordings at home have been stable without significant fluctuations, and she has had no episodes of fainting, severe dizziness, or chest pain that might prompt emergent cardiovascular evaluation. She also asserts that she has had no neurological deficits, explaining she has not experienced any abrupt weaknesses, facial drooping, or speech disturbances consistent with a cerebral event in the last few weeks. The patient remarks that her plan to proceed with this keyhole-type surgery stems primarily from her desire to clarify the abdominal findings and alleviate her episodic distress, which intermittently hinders her enjoyment of meals. She has felt otherwise well-nourished, with no indication of bowel inflammation or related gastrointestinal disorders requiring special therapy, and she remains free of chronic pulmonary conditions that cause ongoing wheezing or frequent infections.

518,38,Free Water Deficit,lab test,decimal,pmc-3147132-1,Extracted,"A 28-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of reduced livido and increased fatigability. He had been in good health until 1 year earlier, when he noticed reduced livido. Four months before admission, he noticed frequent headaches, thirst, polydipsia, and polyuria. Because he was voiding urine every hour, he visited his family doctor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a suprasellar mass, and he was thus referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Although polydipsia and polyuria had been gradually relieved by the time of admission, he became aware of increased fatigability.
At the time of admission, he was 176 cm tall and weighed 72 kg. His temperature was 37.6°C, pulse rate was 60/min, and blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg. No goiter or enlargement of lymph nodes was noted. Axillar and pubic hair were lost and there was palpable erythematous rush on his forehead (). The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory results revealed the following results: blood urea nitrogen 9.6 mg/dL, creatinine 0.79 mg/dL, serum sodium 141 mEq/l, potassium 4.0 mEq/l, chloride 100 mEq/l, calcium 9.4 mg/dL, phosphate 3.7 mg/dL, fasting plasma glucose 80 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein 0.07 mg/dL. Endocrinologic data revealed a mild decrease in free T4 level (0.6 ng/dL) with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level (0.9106 μU/mL) and decreased cortisol (4.7 μg/mL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 6 pg/mL), luteinizing hormone (LH; 0.2 mIU/mL), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH; 1.3 mIU/mL), and testosterone (0.05 ng/mL) levels. Urinary cortisol was undetectable. Plasma osmolality was 288 mOsm/kgH2O, with a urinary osmolality of 239 mOsm/kgH2O, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) was undetectable (<0.15 pg/mL). Urinary output was from 1.5 to 2.2 L/day.
His clinical course and laboratory findings led us to suspect CDI with anterior pituitary dysfunction. We thus performed hormonal provocative tests. The patient was given an infusion of 5% saline at a rate of 0.05 mL/kg for 120 min. Although plasma AVP was undetectable before and after administration of hypertonic saline, urine osmolality (391 mOsm/kgH2O) increased above the plasma levels (296 mOsm/kgH2O) (). Hormonal provocative tests revealed that growth hormone (GH) response to GH-releasing hormone was normal, TSH response to TSH-releasing hormone was low and blunted, and FSH and LH response to LH-releasing hormone were low and blunted (). Although ACTH response to corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) was normal, cortisol response to CRH was low (maximum 13.0 μg/mL). Cortisol response to rapid ACTH stimulation test was low (maximum 15.9 μg/mL). Results of these hormonal tests were compatible with the diagnosis of CDI with partial GC deficiency.
MRI revealed enhancing lesion centrally in the pituitary stalk, which spread continuously to the bottom of the third ventricle, and the high intensity of the posterior lobe was lost, compatible with the diagnosis of CDI (). Considering the patient's age, we first suspected of neurohypophysial germinoma. However, this was unlikely because cerebrospinal fluid was negative for malignant cells, and β-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels were normal. Next, we suspected sarcoidosis because chest X-ray revealed hilar enlargement. A biopsy from the skin of the forehead was performed, which revealed noncaseating granuloma composed of epithelioid cells (). Multinucleated giant cells were also present. Thus, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made.
While waiting for histologic confirmation of biopsy results, hydrocortisone replacement was begun with a dose of 20 mg daily. Soon after the replacement therapy was begun, moderate polyuria (3.5–4.0 liters daily) occurred (). After the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was confirmed, he was treated with 40 mg of prednisolone and his general condition improved. The hypertonic saline test was repeated while he was taking 40 mg of prednisolone. Plasma AVP was undetectable during the hypertonic saline test and urine osmolality was consistently below plasma levels, which was compatible with a diagnosis of CDI (). He was treated with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP).
MRI following prednisolone therapy revealed a reduction in the size of the affected lesion. However, his pituitary function remained unchanged, and he is currently being treated with prednisolone, levothyroxine natrium, HCG, and dDAVP.",What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of kg?

Hence, the concentration value of 141.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 141.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.6 * 72.0 * (141.0/140 - 1) = 0.30857 L.

507,38,Free Water Deficit,lab test,decimal,pmc-4531576-1,Extracted,"A 61-year-old woman was admitted because of weakness and polydipsia. Polydipsia suddenly began one month earlier, followed by progressive general weakness. She was initially evaluated at another hospital for the possibility of diabetes mellitus, but laboratory data were not diagnostic for the disease. She had no history of systemic disease or trauma. A physical examination showed her height to be 150 cm and body weight to be 50 kg. The chest and heart conditions were normal. A breast examination was also normal. The neurological examination on admission was normal. The laboratory tests on admission showed serum sodium at 152 mEq/L, serum potassium at 4.1 mEq/L, fasting blood glucose at 103 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c at 4.9%. The results of the liver and thyroid function tests, as well as the chest X-ray were all within normal limits. We performed the water deprivation test under the impression of diabetes insipidus. Urine osmolarity, after a pitressin injection, was markedly increased (>50%) and the results revealed complete pituitary diabetes insipidus (). A brain MRI was performed to demonstrate abnormal findings in the posterior pituitary gland, but it showed multiple enhanced nodules with surrounding edema in the entirety of the cerebral hemisphere, suggesting brain metastases (). To determine the origin of the brain metastasis, we performed the following diagnostic procedures: mammography, abdominal CT scan, gastroscopy, and bone scintigraphy. The abdominal CT scan showed a 3.5-cm heterogenous mass of the right adrenal gland, which separated the kidney. The mass was suggested grossly as metastases and no other intra-abdominal mass was seen There was no abnormal finding detected by mammography. Two round-shaped, elevated lesions with central umblications were noticed on the antrum and low body of the stomach (). We performed a percutaneous needle biopsy of the right adrenal mass. Histologic examinations of both the gastric tissue and right adrenal mass showed malignant tumors composed of anaplastic cells (). Smears and a cell block from the right adrenal mass showed pleomorphic cells having bizarre nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, which were strongly positive for vimentin and weakly positive for cytokeratin immunostains, but were negative for synaptophysin. Thus, the right adrenal mass was suggested as a metastatic lesion from anaplastic carcinoma. The results of the immunohistochemical studies (cytokeratin, vimentin, desmin, smooth muscle actin, alpha-fetoprotein, and human chorionic gonadotropin) on the gastric tissues favored anaplastic carcinoma rather than sarcoma. The results of the c-kit from adrenal and gastric tissues were negative. The malignant cells of the adrenal mass were closely similar to the malignant cells from gastric tissues. Using an electron microscopy examination, the tumor cells of the gastric tissues were composed of a mixture of round oval cells and pleomorphic cells; and the tumor cells were occasionally joined by desmosome, which is suggested to be the origin of epithelial cells. However, there was no evidence of steroidogenic cells in the adrenal cortical carcinoma including in the well developed SER and mitochondria with tubular cisternae. The ultrastructural findings of the tumor cells were compatible with anaplastic carcinoma, including sarcomatoid carcinoma, rather than cortical carcinoma (). Therefore, the metastatic lesions of the brain and right adrenal gland were assumed to have originated from gastric carcinoma. Further evaluation with bone scintigraphy showed multiple hot uptakes in the patients bones. She was managed with conservative treatment including desmopressin. After the desmopressin treatment, diabetes insipidus was greatly ameliorated. However, she died 3 months after the diagnosis.",What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of kg?

Laboratory workup was significant for initially low glucose 2.5 mmol/L (3.3–5.5 mmol/L), high serum creatinine 632 μmol/L (62–106 umol/L), and high blood urea nitrogen of 21 mmol/L (2.8–8 mmol/L). Serum electrolytes were as follows: potassium (K+) 6.3 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), sodium (NA) 144 mmol/L (135–145mmol/L), bicarbonate (HCO3) 5.8 mmol/L (23–29 mmol/L), and serum chloride 99 mmol/L (99–107 mmol/L). Serum aminotransferases were normal (ALT 31 U/L, AST 27 U/L). He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). With LA of 19 mmol/L, his OG measured 20 with serum osmolarity of 340 mmol/kg (275–295 mmol/kg). Toxicology screening, including serum ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and urine for oxalate crystal, was negative.
Acidosis failed to respond to initial fluid hydration, including intravenous bicarbonate. Thus, the patient underwent 2 sessions of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (HD). After HD, his electrolyte disturbances improved, and intravenous fluid hydration continued. Acute kidney injury (AKI) workup, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, creatinine kinase level, and sepsis workup were unremarkable. Starting day 3, the patient was in a polyuric phase, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), producing between 3 and 6 L per day, and his serum creatinine was decreasing. He was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in good condition with a serum creatinine of 140 μmol/L (62–106 μmol/L). Figure shows serum creatinine trend during the hospitalization, Figure depicts serum lactic acid clearance during hospitalization.
Our patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI. Eventually, his prerenal insult led to acute tubular necrosis, as evident by the polyuric phase the patient exhibited on day three.",What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?  You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.,"{'Chloride': [99.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Bicarbonate': [5.8, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [144.0, 'mmol/L']}",39.2,37.24,41.16,"The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 144.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 144.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 144.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 144.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 144.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 144.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 99.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 99.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 99.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 99.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 99.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 99.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 5.8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 5.8 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 5.8 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 5.8 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 5.8 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 5.8 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 144.0 mEq/L - (99.0 mEq/L + 5.8 mEq/L) = 39.2 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 39.2 mEq/L."
567,40,Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa),lab test,decimal,2,Synthetic,"A 59-year-old male with a history of mild hypertension and no known chronic kidney disease arrived at the emergency department complaining of a three-day history of significantly reduced urinary output and increasing fatigue. He noted that over the preceding week he had experienced less appetite and some mild nausea but no overt abdominal pain or vomiting. He denied fevers, chills, or recent infections, though he had reported a modest decrease in fluid intake because of his nausea. On examination, his blood pressure was at the lower threshold of his usual range, and he had a notable dryness of the oral mucosa suggesting possible volume depletion. His heart sounds were regular, and his lung fields were clear to auscultation without evidence of fluid overload. There was no costovertebral angle tenderness or flank pain on percussion. A focused neurological exam showed he was alert but admitted feeling more lethargic than usual, particularly during the preceding two days. He repeatedly emphasized that his urine volume had been noticeably low since the start of his illness, and he described its color as darker than usual, though without visible hematuria. He had taken his usual antihypertensive medication but had not started any new drugs, including no recent exposure to nephrotoxic agents. He did recall using an over-the-counter analgesic on multiple occasions for mild headaches, though he was unable to specify the exact dosage or frequency. Blood tests revealed a mild elevation in the blood urea nitrogen. Measurement of creatinine was 1.1 mg/dL and his serum sodium was measured at 142 mEq/L. A spot urine sample was obtained to assess for possible acute kidney injury. His urine creatinine was 120 mg/dL, and the urine sodium content in the same sample measured 15 mEq/L, both of which gave important clues about his renal handling of solutes under the current conditions. Although there was no overt sign of infection, additional tests were ordered to rule out subtle pyelonephritis or other urinary tract pathology that can sometimes present atypically with reduced output and nonspecific complaints. The patient’s other lab work, including complete blood count and hepatic function tests, was unremarkable, and a basic metabolic panel demonstrated that the main abnormalities resided in the indices related to renal function and electrolyte balance. Imaging studies, including a renal ultrasound performed shortly after arrival, showed no structural abnormalities such as hydroureter or hydronephrosis that might suggest an obstructive process, and the kidneys appeared of normal size for his age. A focused review of his cardiovascular status showed no significant valvular disease or peripheral edema to suggest a sudden cardiac etiology contributing to fluid mismanagement. The clinical impression was that this individual was likely experiencing acute impairment in renal function in the context of decreased intake and possibly compromised renal perfusion, though other causes had yet to be excluded. Further investigations were aimed at discerning whether his renal dysfunction was related to an intrinsic parenchymal process or an alteration in perfusion to the kidneys. Previous outpatient visits did not reveal any longstanding proteinuria or hematuria, and he had not complained of any prior episodes of acute kidney problems. He expressed concern about his overall decrease in urine production and accompanying fatigue, and he was counseled that additional targeted diagnostic workup would be required to elucidate the precise cause of his renal issues.",What is the patient's Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)?

563,40,Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa),lab test,decimal,pmc-7327389-1,Extracted,"A 69-year-old male was admitted due to quadriparesis via the emergency room (ER). He had multiple comorbidities: old pulmonary tuberculosis, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. His medications included spironolactone, glimepiride, metformin, amlodipine, and telmisartan. Two weeks earlier, however, he was diagnosed with pulmonary aspergillosis and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation at the outpatient department (OPD). A pulmonologist and a cardiologist prescribed oral voriconazole (200 mg twice a day) and dronedarone (400 mg twice a day), respectively. 
At admission, the patient's blood pressure was 124/52 mmHg, and no focal neurologic deficit was noted on physical examination. Serum sodium was 133 mmol/L, potassium was 8.0 mmol/L, calcium was 9.3 mg/dL, phosphorus was 4.7 mg/dL, and creatinine was 1.57 mg/dL. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation and left bundle branch block (). The severe hyperkalemia appeared to be caused by spironolactone and telmisartan coadministration, and these offending agents were discontinued. In addition, hyperkalemia was antagonized by intravenous calcium gluconate and was corrected by administration of intravenous insulin lispro and calcium polystyrene sulfonate. His proteinuria was persistent, reaching 1,131 mg/d in a 24 h urine collection. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.007, pH 5.0, albumin 1+, red blood cells 5–9/high power field (HPF), and white blood cells 3-4/HPF. Additional lab values included a urine sodium of 19.35 mmol/L and urine creatinine of 84.31 mg/dL. Because monoclonal gammopathy was suggested from serum and urine protein electrophoresis, a kidney biopsy was performed. Light microscopic examination revealed two global scleroses among 17 glomeruli sampled and showed marked mesangial expansion with mesangial hypercellularity and global thickening of the glomerular capillary walls. Immunofluorescence revealed lambda light chain-restricted glomerular mesangial and linear capillary loop staining (). Electron microscopic evaluation showed vague, fine granular, amorphous deposits in the mesangium and along the peripheral capillary walls. These pathologic findings were compatible with light chain deposition disease. The immunofixation test revealed that heavy and light chains were IgG and λ, respectively. However, no osteolytic lesions were found, and the bone marrow was normocellular. Thus, he was discharged without specific treatment while maintaining voriconazole.
Nine days later, the patient was readmitted because of gait disturbance and dysarthria. Brain imaging revealed no acute lesion. Bradyarrhythmia was noted (), and acute hemodialysis was undertaken to treat both hypercalcemia (11.7 mg/dL) and hyperkalemia (7.5 mmol/L). Urine sodium was 127 mmol/L, potassium was 19 mmol/L, chloride was 125 mmol/L, creatinine was 36 mg/dL, and osmolality was 372 mOsm/kg H2O. The transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) was calculated to be 2.02, and arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.354, pCO2 38.5 mmHg, pO2 110 mmHg, and HCO3− 20.9 mmol/L. Results of the following endocrine tests were unremarkable: plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone concentration, intact-PTH, and stimulated cortisol. Vitamin D levels were low, and PTH-related peptide was undetectable. We considered the possibility of voriconazole-induced hyperkalemia; therefore, voriconazole was discontinued. Because the follow-up ECG showed the atrial fibrillation was resolved, dronedarone was discontinued. At discharge, his serum sodium was 135 mmol/L, potassium was 4.1 mmol/L, calcium was 9.5 mg/dL, phosphorus was 3.7 mg/dL, protein was 7.5 g/dL, albumin was 3.1 g/dL, and creatinine was 0.69 mg/dL.
Approximately one month later, the patient was readmitted because of massive hemoptysis and required bronchial artery embolization. The pulmonologist prescribed itraconazole to treat pulmonary aspergillosis. One week later, however, itraconazole was switched to a reduced dose (100 mg twice a day) of voriconazole. In the meantime, antihypertensives were switched to manidipine and propranolol.
Sixteen days after voriconazole had been resumed, serum potassium had increased to 5.7 mmol/L, and one day later, the patient again visited the ER because of chest tightness. His serum sodium was 130 mmol/L, potassium was 8.0 mmol/L, calcium was 8.9 mg/dL, phosphorus was 5.8 mg/dL, and creatinine was 1.63 mg/dL. An ECG suggested complete atrioventricular block (), and he recovered normal sinus rhythm after acute hemodialysis (). Once again, voriconazole was replaced with itraconazole (200 mg once a day). Manidipine was discontinued because of the potential drug interaction between azole antifungals and calcium channel blockers. Plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone were 0.26 (normal, 0.32–1.84) ng/mL/h and 3.0 (normal, 4.2–20.9) ng/dL, respectively. No further electrolyte disturbances were noted during the admission for three weeks, and his final follow-up laboratory findings were: serum sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 4.4 mmol/L, calcium 9.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.4 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.85 mg/dL.",What is the patient's Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)?

572,40,Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa),lab test,decimal,7,Synthetic,"A 67-year-old man presented with a three-day history of markedly reduced urine output and intermittent nausea, accompanied by increasing fatigue and a sense of overall weakness. He noted that his oral fluid intake had been lower than usual due to poor appetite and occasional feelings of queasiness, and he had experienced a few episodes of mild dizziness when standing up quickly. He has a known history of hypertension, managed with several medications, although he admits that he has occasionally missed doses over the past few months. He reports no significant changes to his usual medications and denies recent use of any new over-the-counter agents. Upon arrival, he appeared frail and somewhat lethargic, with dry mucous membranes and decreased skin turgor suggesting some degree of volume depletion or inadequate fluid intake. His vital signs revealed a borderline low blood pressure and a slightly elevated heart rate, which raised concerns about his intravascular volume status. Cardiac auscultation identified a distant rhythm consistent with his known hypertensive background, without any distinct murmurs or gallops. He denied active chest discomfort but reported a mild sense of breathlessness when performing minimal exertion. He also denied any significant edema in his lower extremities, though careful inspection suggested potential mild swelling that could not be conclusively distinguished from his usual baseline. Physical examination of his abdomen was largely benign, with no guarding or rebound tenderness, although he did report a vague feeling of pressure in his lower back. He has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia but reports no worsening of voiding symptoms, though the considerable reduction in urine volume is markedly different from his typical bladder habits. Basic laboratory work at the time of presentation demonstrated a serum creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, elevated from his reported baseline near 1.0 mg/dL, indicating a possible acute change in renal function. Additional tests revealed a serum sodium level of 140 mEq/L, which sits near the middle of normal limits. Further urinalysis and related measurements showed that his urine sodium concentration was 25 mEq/L, prompting consideration of possible prerenal versus intrinsic etiologies for this acute drop in output. A notably high measure of urine creatinine, registering at 145 mg/dL, reflected the concentrated nature of his urine during collection. He currently remains oliguric, producing only small volumes of dark, concentrated fluid despite efforts at gentle oral hydration prior to arrival. He denies flank pain or hematuria, and there is no visible sediment when his urine is observed. His outpatient records mention episodes of dizziness in the past associated with inadequate fluid intake, but there is no clear documentation of chronic kidney disease or prior episodes like this. He does, however, acknowledge a prior incident of dehydration during a particularly hot summer week two years ago that prompted an emergency visit for intravenous fluids. As part of the present evaluation, a review of his medication regimen is underway to identify any agents that could contribute to altered renal perfusion, especially since he recalls starting a new antihypertensive approximately one year ago. He has no reports of rash, arthralgias, or fever, reducing the likelihood of systemic inflammatory or infectious processes, and he denies recent travels or changes in diet aside from the reduced intake driven by nausea. A focused cardiac and pulmonary assessment remains unremarkable aside from his known hypertension and mild tachycardia, with chest imaging thus far revealing no acute abnormalities. Plans are in place for additional tests, including renal imaging, to rule out obstruction, and for careful monitoring of fluid balance to better distinguish between prerenal factors and an intrinsic renal cause. He expresses concern about the sudden change in his urine output and wonders if modifications to his antihypertensive therapy or any recent variation in his medication adherence could have contributed to this presentation. He is cooperative with further diagnostic steps, acknowledging the importance of timely identification of potentially reversible factors. The current goal of his care team is to establish the origin of this acute deterioration in kidney function and to provide supportive measures whether the issue proves to be volume-related, related to an underlying renal parenchymal process, or influenced by other factors in his complex clinical picture.",What is the patient's Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)?

949,43,Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score,risk,integer,9,Synthetic,"A 53-year-old male arrived at the emergency department in severe respiratory distress, transferred from a smaller facility where he had been placed on a form of advanced airway intervention due to his inability to maintain adequate oxygenation on minimal support. According to the paramedics, his level of alertness had declined en route, with him barely responding to painful stimuli and failing to follow instructions, suggestive of a notable reduction in mental clarity at the time of presentation. On formal neurologic assessment, his Glasgow  Coma  Score was  7. The arterial blood gas sample obtained upon arrival indicated a partial pressure of oxygen of 74  mm Hg range in the face of a supplemental oxygen concentration of 28 % (FiO₂ 0.28), underscoring the severity of his respiratory compromise. In addition, he received a specialized mode of respiratory assistance that provides a constant level of increased pressure in his airways, presumably to help improve alveolar recruitment. Clinicians initiated dopamine at  4 mcg/kg/min to support or enhance cardiac output in this critically ill individual. Laboratory evaluations at the time of his admission showed a platelet count in the 180,000 µL, which was neither severely depressed nor indicative of pronounced risk for hemorrhage. His bilirubin level measured at 2.2 mg/dL, which corresponded with the presence of subtle jaundice noted on examination and raised questions about underlying hepatic dysfunction or possible hemolysis. While no overt chronic liver disease had been previously documented, he did endorse occasional alcohol use and had recently complained of a decreased appetite. Further labs revealed that his renal status was around the upper range of normal for his demographic, with a creatinine reading of 1 mg/dL, and his reported daily urine output—based on a measurement conducted before any significant therapeutic intervention—was  1800 milliliters, suggesting reasonable kidney performance despite his acute presentation. Clinicians performed a careful review of his cardiovascular findings, affirming that he had a stable pulse and no signs of profound shock, which was reassuring considering the severity of his neurologic and pulmonary problems. Imaging of his thorax pointed to possible bilateral processes, although the precise etiology was not immediately evident, prompting further investigations to rule out a severe infectious or inflammatory trigger. The decision was made to keep him on the advanced airway modality with continuous baseline pressure to optimize oxygenation while allowing for close monitoring of his neurological status, which was compromised enough to warrant concern about airway protection without mechanical support. His depressed consciousness, accompanied by limited eye opening and minimal vocalization, raised the urgency to secure imaging of his central nervous system to exclude any acute intracranial insult. Given the combination of mild hyperbilirubinemia, moderate respiratory failure, and depressed cognition, he was rapidly triaged to a higher level of care for immediate supervision, with further diagnostic exploration aimed at identifying the underlying cause of his multifaceted presentation. Despite the serious nature of his condition, his stable systemic blood pressure, acceptable platelet figure, and apparently preserved renal output offered some hope that his circulatory and renal systems were not yet in grave jeopardy, though the team recognized the potential for rapid changes in this precarious scenario. The tentative plan included aggressive investigation for possible infections, supportive management of his respiratory compromise, and continuous vigilance over his cardiovascular parameters to ensure that his perfusion remained adequate and that no additional hemodynamic agents beyond the single moderate‑dose infusion would be necessary. Additional laboratory panels, cultures, and specialized imaging would help clarify whether his elevated bilirubin stemmed from an acute infectious hepatic insult, hemolytic process, or another hepatic issue altogether. Careful neurological checks were also deemed essential to track any improvement or worsening of his severely lowered awareness level, in the hope that progress could be made once the probable underlying trigger for his respiratory decompensation was identified and addressed.",What is the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score?,"{'PaO2': [74, 'mm Hg'], 'FiO2': [28, '%'], 'On mechanical ventilation': True, 'Continuous positive airway pressure': True, 'Platelet count': [180000, 'µL'], 'Glasgow Coma Score': 7, 'Bilirubin': [2.2, 'mg/dL'], 'Hypotension': False, 'DOPamine': [4, 'mcg/kg/min'], 'creatinine': [1.0, 'mg/dL'], 'Urine Output': [1800, 'mL/day']}",9,9,9,"The criteria for the SOFA Score are shown below:

The total SOFA Score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.
    
The patient's current SOFA score is 0.
The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 74 mm Hg and FiO₂ percentage is 28 %. This means that the patient's partial pressure of oxygen to FiO₂ ratio is 264.28571. The patient is reported to be on mechanical ventillation. The patient is reported to be using continuous positive airway pressure. Because the patient's partial pressure of oxygen to FiO₂ ratio is between 200 and 300, we increase the score by two points, makeing the current total 0 + 2 = 2.
For two points to be given, the patient must be taking less than or equal to 5 micrograms/kg/min or any amount of dobutamine. Because at least one of these cases is true for the patient, we increment the score by two points, making the current total 2 + 2 = 4.
The patient's glasgow coma score is 7. Because the patient's glasgow coma score is between 6 and 9, we add 3 points to the score, making the current score 4 + 3 = 7.
 The concentration of bilirubin is 2.2 mg/dL. Because the patient's bilirubin concentration is at least 2.0 mg/dL, but less than 6.0 mg/dL, we increment the score by two points, make the current score 7 + 2 = 9.
The patient's concentration of platelet is 180000 count/µL. Because the patient's platelet count is at least 150*10³/µL, we do not any points to the score, keeping the current score at 9.
The concentration of creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL. The patients urine output is 1800 mL/day.

Because the patient's creatinine concentration is less than 1.2 mg/dL, we do not add any points to the score, keeping the current total at 9.
Hence, the patient's SOFA score is 9 points."
948,43,Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score,risk,integer,8,Synthetic,"A 62-year-old female with a past history of type  2 diabetes and longstanding mild renal insufficiency presented to the hospital after three days of progressive confusion, severe fatigue, and intermittent lightheadedness. According to her relatives, she had become increasingly lethargic, barely responding to basic questions and often requiring repeated prompts to open her eyes. On examination, her responsiveness was notably diminished; she did not initiate speech unless vigorously stimulated, and her eyes remained closed most of the time unless a painful stimulus was applied. Her verbal output was limited to short, slurred phrases, indicating a substantial decline in her usual mental status. She also appeared to be breathing more rapidly than normal, although her chest movements were symmetric and no overt abnormalities were detected on initial auscultation. After a sample of arterial blood was drawn, analysis revealed that her partial pressure of oxygen measured 89 mm  Hg, and she was receiving an inspired oxygen fraction of 38 % (FiO₂ 0.38), which was instituted given her apparent respiratory distress. Her Glasgow  Coma  Score (GCS) was  8. Her blood pressure upon arrival measured in the 76/52 mm Hg range, representing a marked drop from her typically well‑controlled readings documented in outpatient clinic notes. Her peripheral pulses were faint, and her hands felt cool to the touch, prompting immediate concern for inadequate perfusion. In response to her poor pressures, the clinical team initiated norEPINEPHrine at  0.06 mcg/kg/min to support arterial tone. Additional vital signs showed a fluctuating heart rate in the triple digits, accompanied by regular but labored respirations that required close observation in the acute environment. Laboratory findings pointed toward several abnormalities at the time of her initial assessment. Her platelet count was 175 000 µL, consistent with slight downward shifts from her reported baseline but not reaching a level that would routinely raise concern for hemorrhagic complications. Furthermore, liver function testing demonstrated a total bilirubin of  1.3 mg/dL, although physical examination did not identify overt jaundice. Her renal function appeared to be worsened compared to her usual status, with a serum creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, consistent with at least a moderate acute insult on top of her known chronic issues. Her urine output over the previous 24  hours was 700 mL, and staff noted the possibility that her reduced fluid intake in the preceding days or a developing infectious process could have impaired her kidney output. Although she was poorly communicative, her temperature was not profoundly elevated; yet the team remained suspicious of an underlying infection given the acuity of her presentation and the gradual decline in mental clarity. Beyond her blood pressure challenge, no additional circulatory measures were noted at the time of her arrival, and her veins were somewhat collapsed, suggesting the need for immediate fluid resuscitation to accompany the medication infusion already started to maintain perfusion. She did not exhibit any episodes of overt bleeding, although bruises and mild abrasions on her arms drew some attention in light of her borderline platelet levels. Efforts were directed toward identifying a possible source of infection by obtaining cultures and imaging, while also providing supportive therapy to address her rising creatinine and reduced urine volumes. Her respiratory status called for supplemental oxygen, yet she remained able to breathe spontaneously, albeit with shallow, somewhat rapid respiratory efforts that demanded close monitoring. She had not received any advanced breathing interventions prior to posting these measurements, and her initial chest imaging did not reveal an obvious consolidation nor extensive fluid overload, though the final radiologic interpretations were pending. Despite her depressed level of arousal, she demonstrated occasional agitation when staff attempted to insert intravenous lines, indicating that she retained some protective reflexes even as she struggled to remain awake. The medical team planned frequent rechecks of her neurological status, with concerns that her confusion could reflect a metabolic derangement, an infectious encephalopathy, or a superimposed toxic‑metabolic disturbance. While her coagulation parameters were not dramatically abnormal, clinicians remained vigilant for any further hematologic compromise that might occur alongside the decline in multiple organ functions. Given her relatively elevated bilirubin level, they also contemplated possible hepatic stressors, though her sclera did not show obvious yellow discoloration on gross exam. With multiple sites of potential compromise—including diminished brain responsiveness, threatened hemodynamics, and an acute on chronic renal issue—the immediate priority was to stabilize her respiratory adequacy, maintain organ perfusion through cautious fluid management and vasopressor titrations, and investigate any underlying infectious or inflammatory cause. Her presentation underscored the need for intensive monitoring, with the hope that early targeted interventions would avert further deterioration and facilitate a gradual return toward her baseline status.",What is the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score?,"{'PaO2': [89, 'mm Hg'], 'FiO2': [38, '%'], 'Continuous positive airway pressure': False, 'Platelet count': [175000, 'µL'], 'Glasgow Coma Score': 8, 'Bilirubin': [1.3, 'mg/dL'], 'Hypotension': True, 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [76, 'mm Hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [52, 'mm Hg'], 'norEPINEPHrine': [0.06, 'mcg/kg/min'], 'creatinine': [1.6, 'mg/dL'], 'Urine Output': [700, 'mL/day'], 'On mechanical ventilation': False}",10,10,10,"The criteria for the SOFA Score are shown below:

950,43,Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score,risk,integer,10,Synthetic,"A 74‑year‑old male presented with profound confusion and severely diminished responsiveness, prompting immediate evaluation for possible acute multi‑organ compromise. According to bystanders who accompanied him, he had been increasingly somnolent over the preceding two days, becoming nearly unarousable by the time of hospital arrival. Initial assessment revealed that he was breathing without the assistance of a tube or other advanced apparatus but required supplemental oxygen at a concentration of 33 %—roughly one‑third above ambient levels. Despite this added oxygen, his arterial sample showed a partial pressure of 68 mm Hg, indicating sub‑optimal gas exchange. He had dangerously low arterial pressure on arrival, with measurements of 76/32 mm Hg;  he was started on an intravenous medication at 5 mcg/kg/min of DOPamine along with 0.07 mcg/kg/min norEPINEPHrine. Of note, two other intravenous therapies that are sometimes considered when significant cardiac or vascular support is necessary were not added at this time. Laboratory evaluations performed urgently revealed several abnormalities. His platelet count was found to be 200 000 / µL, which remains within acceptable limits yet will be watched closely in the context of possible systemic dysfunction. Another noteworthy finding was a total bilirubin level measured at 2.5 mg/dL, signifying a degree of hepatobiliary distress that could stem from either pre‑existing liver vulnerability or a more acute systemic insult. Renal indicators likewise raised concern: his serum creatinine was 2.4 mg/dL, suggesting precipitous kidney stress or an acute‑on‑chronic injury. Despite this worrisome finding, he managed to produce 2 000 mL of urine over a day’s time before presentation, showing that at least some degree of filtration and fluid excretion was continuing, though the ultimate viability of this function remained in question. Clinicians were particularly alarmed by his severely decreased cognitive responses. They noted that he did not reliably open his eyes spontaneously, rarely demonstrated coherent verbal skills, and occasionally withdrew from painful stimuli but did not exhibit the purposeful resistance that might be expected in a less compromised state, giving a GCS of 9. This level of unresponsiveness could carry implications for airway protection and further respiratory compromise, so the care team kept him under constant observation in a setting equipped to intervene quickly. Despite his markedly reduced alertness, he exhibited no major indications of widespread bleeding tendencies, maintaining an intact platelet count without unwarranted bruising or bleeding from venipuncture sites. There was no obvious sign of shock as determined by standard circulatory parameters, yet the mild infusion of two intravenous agents to bolster cardiac output and systemic blood flow seemed prudent given his risk factors. Imaging studies were ordered to explore possible causes of acute mental status change; early suspicions included metabolic derangements, hepatic dysfunction, occult infection, or other inflammatory triggers that could precipitate such a presentation. In the absence of overt respiratory failure requiring a breathing apparatus, he was allowed to breathe spontaneously with carefully titrated supplemental oxygen. Healthcare providers remained especially mindful of his advanced years and unknown baseline organ performance, contemplating whether his kidney dysfunction might be longstanding or newly emergent. Additional diagnostic steps, including a thorough review of historical labs and potential nephrotoxic exposures, were initiated. Plans called for ongoing neurological checks, repeated measurements of his arterial oxygen, and close tracking of his urine output and evolving laboratory parameters. Although he displayed worrisome neurologic depression, the absence of alarmingly low blood pressure and the presence of continued, albeit possibly tenuous, urine production offered some measure of cautious optimism. The immediate treatment efforts aimed to stabilize oxygenation, preserve end‑organ perfusion with carefully dosed intravenous medications, and identify any factors that could explain or exacerbate hepatic and renal strain. No significant prior medical records were available at the time of his initial evaluation, which introduced another layer of complexity when formulating a definitive care plan. Nonetheless, the early provision of supportive therapies, vigilant hemodynamic monitoring, and timely diagnostic workup stood as the principal approach to prevent further deterioration. His condition at presentation underscored the gravity of severe neurologic depression, elevated bilirubin, deteriorating renal indicators, and sub‑optimal oxygen exchange, all unfolding despite a near‑normal range of blood pressure measurements. Close multidisciplinary collaboration was deemed essential to elucidate the underlying cause, tailor potential treatments, and determine the best path forward in safeguarding both his neurologic prognosis and multi‑organ function.",What is the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score?,"{'PaO2': [68, 'mm Hg'], 'FiO2': [33, '%'], 'On mechanical ventilation': False, 'Platelet count': [200000, 'µL'], 'Glasgow Coma Score': 9, 'Bilirubin': [2.5, 'mg/dL'], 'Hypotension': True, 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [76, 'mm Hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [32, 'mm Hg'], 'DOPamine': [5, 'mcg/kg/min'], 'norEPINEPHrine': [0.07, 'mcg/kg/min'], 'creatinine': [2.4, 'mg/dL'], 'Urine Output': [2000, 'mL/day']}",12,12,12,"The criteria for the SOFA Score are shown below:

medical history who presented to a school-based cholesterol and diabetes screening.
Her height and weight were 155 cm and 39.5 kg, respectively, and her body mass index
was at the 20th percentile for age and sex. Her vital signs were within normal
limits, her blood pressure was not elevated, and she was well-appearing. Her
screening lipid panel was within normal limits (cholesterol 125 mg/dL, high-density
lipoprotein 49 mg/dL, and triglycerides 68 mg/dL).
Point-of-care screening HgbA1C was significant for a value of 8.5% with a repeat
value of 8.7%. The endocrinology team was consulted by phone and the patient denied
symptoms of weight loss, polydipsia, polyuria, nocturia, and polyphagia; however, a
strong family history of diabetes was reported ().
In the setting of a new diagnosis of diabetes, she was referred to the Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital Medical Center Emergency Department for further evaluation and
management. On evaluation in the emergency department additional laboratory studies
were sent to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes and evaluate its etiology. Laboratory
studies included a repeat serum HgbA1C, electrolytes, urinalysis, and an islet cell
autoantibody screen. Additionally, routine new-onset diabetes screening laboratory
tests, which included a thyroid stimulating hormone, immunoglobulin A (IgA), and
tissue transglutaminase IgA, were also sent. On laboratory evaluation, she had no
evidence of acidosis or urine ketones and a random serum glucose was within normal
limits (111 mg/dL) but with glycosuria. In the setting of a normal random serum
glucose and absence of acidosis in a well-appearing patient, she was discharged home
with the plan for close endocrine follow-up.
The repeat serum HgbA1C resulted after the patient was discharged and was elevated at
10.3% and her islet cell autoantibody screen and all other screening labs returned
as negative. On telephone follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic and a family
history obtained was significant for diabetes spanning 4 generations (see for pedigree). To
further confirm a diagnosis of new-onset diabetes an oral glucose tolerance test was
performed. Fasting glucose (89 mg/dL) and insulin (3.8 µIU/mL) were both within
normal limits. However, her oral glucose tolerance test results were consistent with
the diagnosis of diabetes, with glucose elevation to 313 mg/dL at 2 hours. In the
setting of new-onset diabetes, a negative islet cell autoantibody screen and a
family history of autosomal dominant diabetes, a diagnosis of MODY was suspected.
Confirmatory gene sequencing was sent and revealed a heterozygous mutation in HNF4A
gene designated c.200G>A (p. Arg67Gln) consistent with MODY1. This variant has
been reported previously. Ophthalmic examination and renal function laboratory tests
were both within normal limits. To date, the patient’s glycemic control has been

The patient was a 34-year-old male immigrant to the US from Asia who was admitted to the medical floor of a community hospital for the management of his medical problems. He had experienced a recurrent history of anxiety and mild somatic symptoms for the past five years. He reported sleeping difficulties, panic attacks, ruminative worries, muscle tension, body weakness, and chest discomfort. The patient had a prior psychiatric history and hospitalization for anxiety and depression. He had been admitted for anxiety and depression in a free-standing health facility five years ago and had been treated with medications. He had been prescribed sertraline and quetiapine but had self-discontinued because of tolerability issues. He had continued to be anxious with mild somatic symptoms. The patient denied any manic or psychotic symptoms or any neurological symptoms. The patient also denied any suicidal or homicidal ideations. He had no history of substance use or alcohol intake. He had a family history of anxiety disorder, described as an obsessive-compulsive disorder in his mother. In 2019, he had consulted a physician who had performed an extensive medical workup. All test results were unremarkable; he was reassured and his symptoms improved. During the two to three weeks prior to the current presentation, his anxiety and somatic symptoms had recurred and had subsequently worsened. He was then admitted for further investigation.
Examination
The mental status examination revealed a young man who was neat and well-groomed. He was cooperative, calm, and made appropriate eye contact. His speech was normal. He described his mood as anxious and his affect was constricted. His thought process was normal and linear. There was no suicidal or homicidal ideation. No delusions or hallucinations were reported. He was awake, alert, and oriented to time, place, people, and events. His judgment and insight were fair.
Investigation
He underwent a 12-lead electrocardiogram, which showed a ventricular rate of 80 beats/minute (reference range: 60-100 beats/minute), atrial rate of 80 beats/minute (reference range: 60-100 beats/minute), PR interval of 148 milliseconds (reference range: 120-200 milliseconds), QRS duration of 94 milliseconds (reference range: 80-100 milliseconds), QT interval of 350 milliseconds (reference range: 360-430 milliseconds), and QTC calculation (Bazett) of 403 milliseconds (reference range: ≤440 milliseconds) with normal sinus rhythm.
Other medical workups done revealed thyroid-stimulating hormone of 2.398 uIU/mL (reference range: 0.35-5.5 uIU/mL), hemoglobin A1c of 5.6% (reference range: <5.7%), and urinalysis showing no ketones or proteins. Lipid profile showed cholesterol of 182 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: <200 milligrams per deciliter), high-density lipoprotein of 39 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: <40 milligrams per deciliter), and a slightly elevated triglyceride of 196 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: <150 milligrams per deciliter). His basic metabolic panel was as follows: sodium of 140 millimoles per liter (reference range: 136-145 millimoles per liter), potassium of 4.1 millimoles per liter (reference range: 3.6-5.2 millimoles per liter), chloride of 104 millimoles per liter (reference range: 98-106 millimoles per liter), glucose of 93 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 70-100 milligrams per deciliter), calcium of 9.3 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 8.5-10.5 milligrams per deciliter), phosphorus of 4.0 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 3.4-4.5 milligrams per deciliter), blood urea nitrogen of 9 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 7-20 milligrams per deciliter), and creatinine of 1.0 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 0.84-1.21 milligrams per deciliter). His complete blood count revealed a hematocrit of 48.9% (reference range: 38.3-48.6%), mean corpuscular volume of 84.7 femtoliters (reference range: 80-96 femtoliters), and red cell distribution width of 12.5% (reference range: 11.8-14.5%). All of these results were unremarkable. Also, an MRI of the brain without contrast was unremarkable. His vitamin B12 was unremarkable as well: 337 picograms per milliliter (reference range: 160-950 picograms per milliliter).

Pertinent laboratory values were as follows: sodium: 120 mEq/L (L), potassium: 4 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen: 21 mg/dL (H), and creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL (H); white blood cell: 13 900/µL (H), neutrophil %: 89.4 (H), and lymphocyte %: 5.5 (L); hemoglobin: 13.3 g/dL, platelets: 250 000/µL; and Dimer 2.74 (H), C-reactive protein: 29.32 mg/dL (H), ferritin: 826.30 ng/mL (H), lactate dehydrogenase: 1883 U/L (H), interleukin-6: 224.35 pg/mL (H), and troponin <0.019 (ng/mL). RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) nasopharyngeal swab returned positive for COVID.
The patient was managed on nonrebreather mask and nasal cannula; he received ceftriaxone, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and was enrolled in the ongoing remdesivir trial. After developing severe hypoxia on day 2 with oxygen saturation to the 60s off his non-rebreather mask, which he had removed, he was rapidly intubated. He had hypotension post-intubation which required vasopressor therapy; however, no overt shock was demonstrated. Lactate remained below 2.5, post intubation and serum creatinine remained below 0.8 mg/dL. Troponinemia worsened (0.194-0.682 ng/mL), and due to concern for acute PE, a heparin drip was initiated. The patient’s hospital course would continue with fluctuating hypoxia on ventilation while receiving heparin (intravenous), sedatives, and occasionally paralytics. He was continuously febrile and required pressor support for suboptimal blood pressures. Duplex study revealed no deep vein thrombosis in lower extremities and transthoracic echocardiography was without intracavitary thrombus.
On the morning of day 6, physical examination revealed diminished pupillary reflexes and mid-dilated pupils without corneal or oculocephalic reflexes, which persisted after withdrawing sedation. Computed tomography (CT) head revealed large ischemic infarcts involving bilateral occipital, left parietal, right temporal, and right frontal lobes with downward herniation into basal cisterns (). CT chest with angiography disclosed extensive multifocal dense ground-glass opacities in the lungs without PE. Taking the patient’s clinical deterioration, and severity of radiographic findings into consideration, no further workup was pursued.

The patient had no past medical history until last week. She has been feeling “under the weather” for a couple of days. She presented a fever, a cough with some phlegm and chills. She also complained of some sharp chest pain when she took a breath. She denied smoking.
Physical examination revealed a patient with dyspnea in acute distress. Her temperature was 105 °F. Her blood pressure was 80/40 mm Hg (normally 120/80 mm Hg). Her heart rate was 140 beats per minute (normally 60–80 bpm) and regular. Her extremities felt cool to the touch and had mottled skin. She had decreased skin turgor.
After initial evaluation, she was put on 100% oxygen via a face mask. Even breathing 100% oxygen, her blood oxygen saturation was only 92% (normally >95% on room air and 100% on 100% inspired oxygen). Her respiratory rate was 35 breaths per minute (normally 15 breaths/min). Examination of the lungs revealed bilateral rales (crackly lung noises heard on inspiration that indicate fluid in the alveoli), which were more prominent at the bases. Her jugular veins were not distended and she had no hepatojugular reflux. The point of maximal impulse was in the fifth intercostal space along the left midclavicular line. She was tachycardic, with normal S1 and S2. There were no rubs, murmurs, or gallops. Peripheral pulses were weak on both sides. Her abdomen had some decreased bowel sounds but was otherwise normal.
After she was put on 100% oxygen, the laboratory assayed a sample of arterial blood from the patient and obtained the following values (normal values in parentheses): pH 6.98 (7.38-7.42), PCO2 50 mmHg (37-43), PO2 80 (>90 on room air), calculated HCO3 10 (22-32), creatinine 2.5 mg/dl (0.5-1.5), blood urea nitrogen 40 mg/dl (5-25), Na+ 145 mEq/L (133-147), K+ 3.7 mEq/L (3.2-5.2), Cl- 103 mEq/L (94-110), HCO3- 12 mEq/L (22-32), lactate 5 mEq/L (<1.5).
Her white blood cell count was elevated (normal 4 – 12 × 103 per microliter) and immature white cells were present. Her hemoglobin and hematocrit were normal, but her platelet count was low. Also, her urine output was low.
Chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema that was more pronounced at the bases and at the hila.
A lung CT scan showed extra density at the bases.
An ECG showed sinus tachycardia but was otherwise within normal limits.
The diagnosis was community-acquired pneumonia and septic shock. The patient was intubated and treated using lung protective ventilation.

This patient had a fever, chill, cough, and progressive dyspnea after being in the rain on August 9, 2019, without a sore throat, chest pain, hemoptysis, paroxysmal dyspnea, dizziness, nausea, abdominal distension, abdominal pain or diarrhea. He first went to a local clinic and was treated with “anti-inflammatory drugs (the specific name is unknown)”, but his symptoms became more severe and rapidly progressive. One day before admission, the patient started having aggravated dyspnea, listlessness, and difficulty talking while lying down, then this patient presented to our emergency room (ER).
The physical exam revealed the following: T 36°C, P 82bpm, RR 28/min, BP 107/64mmHg, SpO2 72%, WBC 20.36×10^9/L, N 18.31×10^9/L; arterial blood gas (ABG) showed PH 7.12, PO2 55mmHg, PCO2 56mmHg, SaO2 85%, Lactate 4.4mmol/L, BE-11.7mmol/L; BUN 18.1mmol/L, creatinine 166umol/L; BNP 249.83pg/mL with peripheral cyanosis and bilateral wheezing. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a dense consolidation site in the right lung with scattered shadows in both lungs, accompanying by mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, the CT results indicated the infection lesion (). He had been healthy previously, but he was a smoker with a 30-year history. He did not use illicit drugs and had no known allergies to medications. He worked as a farmer and have no family history. He was diagnosed as follows: 1. Severe pneumonia 2. Sepsis 3. Septic shock 4. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) 5. Type II respiratory failure 6. Heart failure 7. Acute renal insufficiency 8. Metabolic acidosis 9. Chronic bronchitis.
Laboratory examinations were supplemented and the results were as follows (August 31, 2019): Blood routine: neutrophil count 7.29×10^9/L, lymphocyte count 0.97×10^9/L, monocyte count 0.82×10^9/L, neutrophil percentage 79.2%, lymphocyte percentage 10.5%, red blood cell count 3.01×10^12/L, hemoglobin 86 g/L, hematocrit 0.28 L/L, mean corpuscular hemoglobin 305 g/L, platelet distribution width 9.2fl, C-reactive protein (CRP) 106.44 mg/L; hepatorenal function: ALT 15U/L, AST 13U/L, Creatinine 75umol/L. Orotracheal intubation was applied to help the patient’s respiration, assisting with the PB840 ventilator. Combined with the examination results of chest CT, the patient was provided with imipenem and cilastatin sodium 1.0g q12h, linezolid 0.6g q12h, and moxifloxacin 0.4g qd for anti-infection therapy. After a 3-day treatment, this patient still had a high fever with a maximum body temperature of 38.5°C. Continuous invasive mechanical ventilation was performed to assist the respiration, meanwhile, continuous vasoactive drugs and intravenous nutrition support were given to him.
Sputum cultures were collected and Gram stain revealed no squamous epithelial cells, few neutrophils, and Gram-negative rods. Within one day, sputum sample results showed P. aeruginosa and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (). Besides, fiberscope secretion cultures showed P. aeruginosa, which is sensitive to amikacin, gentamicin and piperacillin sodium and tazobactam sodium, intermediate to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime, but resistant to imipenem and meropenem (). Based on the culture results, we changed the treatment strategy to the combination of polymyxin B (50IU, q12h) and amikacin (0.6g, qd) for 30 days, instead of imipenem (1g q12h) and cilastatin sodium (500mg, q12h).
The patient’s body temperature was back to 37°C, measured by a clinical thermometer for armpit use for 10 minutes. His cough was significantly alleviated with white viscous sputum. On day 21, laboratory examinations demonstrated the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CRP and procalcitonin were negative; AST 14U/L, total protein 63.2g/L, albumin 30.3g/L, total calcium 2.1mmol/L, phosphorus 0.84mmol/L, sialic acid 723mg/L. On day 23, chest CT was rechecked to confirm the curative effect, which showed the formation of a pulmonary thick-walled cavity in the apical segment of the left upper lobe, with multiple small opacities, branching signs, bronchial wall thickening, and fibrous lesion. The inflammation of the cavity wall was obviously reduced compared with the first CT images (). The patient was discharged in a stable condition on day 35, and he was given acetylcysteine tablets 0.6g/box, 1 tablet, bid. The final diagnoses on discharge were represented: 1. Severe pneumonia 2. Sepsis 3. Septic shock 4. MODS 5. Type II respiratory failure 6. Heart failure 7. Acute renal insufficiency 8. Metabolic acidosis 9. Chronic bronchitis 10. Hypoproteinemia.
After he was discharged, a regular follow-up of 2 weeks was performed to monitor his condition until most indicators came back to the normal level. The results of laboratory examinations showed as follows (September 17, 2019): Blood routine: white blood cell 9.57×10^9/L, neutrophil count 6.78×10^9/L, lymphocyte count 1.24×10^9/L, neutrophil percentage 70.8%, lymphocyte percentage 13%, red blood cell count 3.92×10^12/L, hemoglobin 111 g/L, hematocrit 0.35 L/L, mean corpuscular hemoglobin 318 g/L, platelet distribution width 9.2fl, C-reactive protein (CRP) 19.04 mg/L, PCT 0.19ng/mL; hepatorenal function: ALT 25U/L, AST 37U/L, Creatinine 75umol/L.

The total CURB-65 score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.

The CURB-65 score is current at 0 points.
The patient is 67 years old. The patient's age is greater than or equal to 65 years, and so we add 1 point to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
Whether the patient has confusion is not reported in the note. Hence, we assume this to be false, and so 0 points are added to the score, making the current total 1.
The concentration of BUN is 18.1 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of BUN from mmol to mg. The mass of BUN is 18.1 mmol. To convert 18.1 mmol of BUN to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 18.1 mmol BUN * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.0181 mol BUN. To convert from mol BUN to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.0181 mol BUN * 28.02 g/mol = 0.50716 g BUN. To convert 0.50716 g of BUN to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.50716 g BUN * 1000.0 mg/g = 507.16 mg BUN. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 507.16 mg BUN/10.0 dL = 50.716 mg BUN/dL. The concentration value of 18.1 mmol BUN/L converts to 50.716 mg BUN/dL. The patient's BUN concentration is greater than 19 mg/dL and so we add 1 point to score making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The patient's respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 2.
The patient's systiolic blood pressure is 107 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 64 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg.

617,46,Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease,lab test,decimal,1,Synthetic,"A 62-year-old male presents to the clinic for a routine evaluation of his overall cardiovascular health, reporting occasional fatigue but denying significant exercise intolerance or concerning chest pain. He states that his recent activities have been limited due to a busy schedule, and he acknowledges that he has not maintained a consistent regimen of physical exercise, although he tries to walk for short distances on weekends. He does not recall any significant use of tobacco in the past and expresses that he has never felt drawn to such habits. He reports no symptoms suggestive of lung problems or chronic cough. His family history is notable for several paternal relatives who experienced elevated blood pressure and related complications later in life, though he is unsure of the full extent of their conditions. He affirms that he has been taking a daily pharmacologic agent prescribed by his previous provider to manage his elevated blood pressure, which he says has helped him avoid headaches and dizziness. On examination, his body habitus is moderately overweight but not excessively so, with a waist circumference that indicates a need for further weight management counseling. His heart rate is regular, and no murmurs, gallops, or rubs are detected on auscultation. The peripheral pulses are intact, and there is no evidence of peripheral edema. Today, his systolic blood pressure reading is 145 mm Hg in the right arm seated position, which is consistent with previous values and indicates some degree of systolic elevation despite his daily therapeutic regimen. Laboratory tests obtained at this appointment reveal a total cholesterol of 230 mg/dL, which he attributes to sporadic dietary excesses, particularly a fondness for red meat dishes and limited consumption of fiber-rich foods. He admits that he has struggled with dietary restrictions, especially when attending social gatherings, but expresses willingness to improve his current habits. His high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, measured at 45 mg/dL, falls within a range that prompts re-emphasis on lifestyle modifications to optimize his lipid profile. He states that he has never been diagnosed with conditions such as chronic hyperglycemia or other metabolic derangements, and previous tests have not shown significant glucose abnormalities. He denies any prior hospital admissions for heart-related issues, has never undergone coronary catheterization or procedures, and does not have a history of chest pains associated with exertion. He does mention mild occasional twinges in his chest area when highly stressed, but these episodes are transient and not accompanied by any radiation of discomfort or associated symptoms like diaphoresis or palpitations. Current review of symptoms is otherwise unremarkable, with no persistent cough, no gastrointestinal complaints, and no changes in vision or sensation. He acknowledges the possibility that aging and inherited risk factors may contribute to his concerns. Because of this, he expresses interest in enhancing his diet and exercise, especially exploring guided programs that can fit his busy schedule. He agrees to continue his current plan for managing blood pressure and considers discussing additional measures to address his cholesterol levels, such as modifying his nutritional intake and possibly beginning a more rigorous exercise routine. He will also follow up for further assessments, including more precise evaluations of his overall cardiovascular risk, with the goal of maintaining stable readings and preventing the onset of adverse cardiac events.","Based on the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease, what is the likelihood of 10-year risk of MI or death for this patient?

The patient's smoking status is not provided, so the smoker variable is set to 0.
The patient is not on medication for blood pressure, so the bp_medicine variable is 0.
The concentration of 386.654 is 103.0 mg/dL. The concentration of hdl cholesterol is 36.0 mg/dL. The patient's systolic blood pressure is 122 mm Hg.
Plugging in the values into the risk score formula, we get 52.00961 * ln(47) + 20.014077 * ln(103.0) + -0.905964 * ln(36.0) + 1.305784 * ln(122) + 0.241549 * 0 + 12.096316 * 0 + -4.605038 * ln(47) * ln(103.0) + -2.84367 * ln(47) * 0 + -2.93323 * ln(47) * ln(47) - 172.300168 = -1.924.
To obtain the 10-year risk percentage, we plug this into the formula as: [1 - 0.9402^exp(risk_score)] * 100 = 0.8959853138689633.
Hence, the patient's 10-year risk percentage of MI or death is 0.896%."
618,46,Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease,lab test,decimal,2,Synthetic,"A 55-year-old woman presents for evaluation of her cardiovascular health and general wellness. She has never been diagnosed with any cardiac conditions and denies any prior episodes of chest pain, documented heart attacks, or other forms of heart disease. She also reports no known history of diabetes. Her primary motivation for this visit stems from a recent feeling of fatigue and a desire to ensure that she is maintaining healthy habits as she enters her midlife years. She mentions that she has enjoyed relatively good health overall but acknowledges that she has a long-standing habit involving regular tobacco use, citing difficulty in quitting despite multiple considerations in the past. She remains concerned about how this habit may be affecting her overall health, and she expresses an interest in discussing cessation strategies once she completes her initial evaluation. Despite her concerns about potential blood pressure issues, she has never been prescribed medication specifically to address elevated readings in the past. Her blood pressure measurement during this appointment shows a systolic reading of 135, which is slightly higher than previous measurements but not alarmingly so. She notes that her diet has been somewhat variable over the years, often including a moderate amount of vegetables and lean meats, though she concedes that her snack choices sometimes lean heavily toward processed options. She admits that her level of physical activity has diminished somewhat recently because of increased family obligations and longer work hours, making it challenging for her to engage in structured exercise routines. Nonetheless, she occasionally participates in weekend walks or light recreational activities. She remembers receiving a clinical consultation a few years ago noting that her cholesterol levels had been on the higher side of the normal range. At today’s visit, her laboratory results indicate a total cholesterol level of 210, which she finds concerning, given her family history of various cardiovascular problems on her paternal side; her father experienced some cardiac symptoms in his 70s, although specifics are not fully detailed in her recollection. She notes that this familial pattern has prompted her to remain vigilant about her own risk. Additional labs reveal that her high-density lipoprotein level is 55 mg/dL, a value that her healthcare providers indicated was not as worrisome as some other measures, though she is eager to have any abnormal cholesterol trends addressed. She denies any issues with blurred vision, excessive thirst, or frequent urination, and her last fasting glucose assessment at a previous exam was within the normal range, further supporting the absence of diabetes. She states that her energy levels tend to be unpredictable yet not sufficiently problematic to disrupt her routine activities, and she denies any incidents of fainting, shortness of breath, or sensations of heart palpitations. She has never undergone any procedures or interventions for arterial blockages, valve problems, or arrhythmias, and she has never required hospitalization for significant cardiac events. Her body weight, while not severely high, has trended upward in recent years, which she attributes to her increasingly sedentary work. She expresses a desire to discuss both lifestyle modifications and potential steps to better manage her cardiovascular health moving forward. The patient hopes to refocus on improving her dietary regimen, reevaluating her relationship with tobacco, and possibly incorporating a regular exercise program that fits her schedule. Her planned follow-up includes close monitoring of her blood pressure and repeat measurements of cholesterol, as she aspires to maintain or improve these parameters before considering any pharmacological approaches. She is motivated to prevent disease and maintain her quality of life, which she perceives as generally good but threatened by her longstanding habit of tobacco use and the possibility of further elevation in her cholesterol measurements that might place her at risk if not addressed proactively.","Based on the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease, what is the likelihood of 10-year risk of MI or death for this patient?

The patient reported brief, severe, colicky episodes of mid and left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain that radiated to his testicles. He vomited several times because of the pain, which he stated began suddenly while he was lying down. Notably, the patient had recently got over a diarrheal illness a few days prior, followed by constipation, and had recurrence of one loose stool on the day of presentation. He denied any flank pain or back pain, and had never experienced anything like this current illness before.
The patient had no prior medical or surgical history, and had no known family history. His family lived in Honduras, but the patient was currently incarcerated. He was previously a one-pack-per-day smoker, drank alcohol one to two times per month, but denied drug use. Review of systems was negative for weight loss, headaches, chest pain, shortness of breath, melena, hematemesis, rashes, or joint swelling.
The vital signs were as follows: temperature 37.0°C orally, pulse 103 beats per minute, respiratory rate 11 breaths per minute (bpm), blood pressure 122/67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. Physical examination revealed an alert young man intermittently doubled over in pain with spontaneous resolution. The heart was tachycardic and regular without murmurs, rubs or gallops. The lungs were clear bilaterally with normal work of breathing and no wheezes, rhonchi or rales. His abdomen was soft and non-distended with normoactive bowel sounds, but he demonstrated diffuse tenderness and guarding to palpation. He had no midline or costovertebral angle tenderness, and no ecchymoses were present on inspection of his back. His skin was warm, dry and without any obvious rashes. His neurological examination was grossly intact throughout. The patient was uncircumcised, and his right testicle was lying higher than his left, but neither was tender or swollen. No masses or inguinal hernias were appreciated in the groin.

From the time of onset, the pain was categorized to be severe, not colic and was localized to the epigastric region only. The patient was alert and ill, while she has had nausea and anorexia, but was not been accompanied by vomiting. Her vital signs were as follows: BP: 85/50, PR: 130, T: 37.2, and RR: 18. Her head, neck, and chest (heart and lung) were normal, and abdomen was fatty and without scarlet and reduced intestinal sounds. She had generalized tenderness with maximum pain intensity in epigastric regions, where her organs were normal. Her medical and corresponding drug history was as follows: antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, DVT, a history of two abortions, and type II diabetes.
Her drug history included: prednisolone tablets, 5 mg: once a day; methotrexate: three pounds a week; hydroxychloroquine tablet: 3 days a week; and warfarin tablets: daily half a pill and insulin.
For further examination, her cardiac activity was monitored, and serum therapy was given to the patient. She was also provided a nasogastric tube, Foley catheter for urinary drainage along with hydrocortisone and antibiotics.
After about 60 minutes, her vitals were as follows: BP: 100/60 and PR: 120.
The result of the preliminary tests showed WBC: 4200, Hb: 7.7, PLT: 80 000, and INR: 4.7 and other tests: normal. Ultrasound from the patient's bedside showed free fluid in the abdomen. Following these tests, the therapeutic intervention was continued as follows: serum, wo packed cell (PC) units, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) units. Meanwhile, the patient was prepared for laparotomy where, during the surgery, her sugar levels kept under control, control, stress-dose cortisol was provided, and she received 5 units of PC and 4 units of FFP.
During the laparotomy, about 3 L of blood and clot were removed from the abdomen. Following this, a cystic lesion was observed in the vicinity of the large stomach flexion that bled due to the invasion of the gastroepyloid vessels (Figure ). After controlling the bleeding, the lesion was fully resected, and samples were examined for pathology (Figure ).
Postoperatively, complete control of the bleeding was achieved with sustained vital signs. However, given the state of preoperative hemorrhagic shock, the patient was kept in ICU until satisfactory recovery was achieved. She also received 5 units of PC and 4 units of FFP, and the vital signs were maintained stable.
Despite there was no recurrence of hemorrhage, she presented pancytopenia perhaps due to the underlying disease (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome). She was hyper-coagulopathic, due to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic shock (cause of referral); therefore, anticoagulant administration was not possible.
After 24 hours and ensuring the stability of vital signs and the absence of Ileus, the patient oral feed was resumed. The postoperative examination for pancytopenia was as follows: WBC: 1500 (PMN: 60%), Hb: 11, PLT: 50 000, INR: 1.7, and K: 3.2. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) therapy was prescribed to the patients after which, her platelets and WBCs showed improvement. The patient's general condition improved, she tolerated the diet, and the bleeding was controlled. Her hemoglobin level did not drop, and therefore, she was transferred to the general ward.
The continuation of treatment was as follows: hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone: half a tablet twice a day, methotrexate was discontinued for 2 weeks, and folic acid and GCSF for 3 days.
Laboratory results showed: platelet <100 000, potassium <3.5, and INR: 1.6. She was administered anticoagulant prophylaxis.
Nine days after the operation, the patient suffered from shortness of breath and tachypnea and a feeling of pressure in the chest. According to the history of the disease, the first diagnosis was a pulmonary embolism, for which anticoagulant therapy was immediately initiated and the patient was transferred to ICU. Her laboratory findings revealed: a decrease in platelets 20 000 and an increase in INR > 3 while ECG was normal. Anticoagulant therapy was restarted.

He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5℃. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.
Chest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.
After three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.
Percutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.
We subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma.

751,60,Body Surface Area Calculator,physical,decimal,pmc-4208265-1,Extracted,"A 16-year-old Korean male presented with two episodes of lower leg paralysis in the morning for two weeks. The first episode was a sudden onset of complete paralysis below distal thigh, and he had no other symptoms except leg paralysis. At a local clinic, physical examination revealed symmetric hyporeflexia in both lower extremities. Laboratory analysis revealed mild hypokalemia as below: Na+, 146 mmol/L; K+, 2.7 mmol/L; Cl-, 110 mmol/L; tCO2, 25 mmol/L without abnormality of blood gas analysis. Electrocardiogram showed only sinus tachycardia without atrioventricular block or prominent U wave. However, further evaluation for hypokalemia was not taken, even though there was a suggestion of hypokalemic paralysis, and the patient was just advised to eat an adequate dietary supplement of potassium rich food without any medication by the local clinic. After two weeks, a second episode of leg weakness occurred after morning meal. The muscle weakness was initially subtle but progressed in paralysis below knee and lasted for 6 hours. Thus, he was referred to our hospital. However, the patient visited our clinic the next day, when the paralysis had already subsided.
There was no past history or family history of neuromuscular disease and endocrinologic disease, except for his aunt's hypothyroidism. His appearance was reasonably healthy. His height was 168 cm, his weight was 60 kg, and his body mass index was 21.2 kg/m2. His blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg, his respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and his body temperature was 36.8℃. He had mild tachycardia with a heart rate of 100-110 beats/min,, but he had no palpitations. Neurological examination findings, including deep tendon reflex and cerebellar function test, were normal. The laboratory findings showed normal complete blood cell counts, normal electrolytes as below: Na+, 140 mmol/L; K+, 4.4 mmol/L; Cl-, 104 mmol/L; tCO2, 24 mmol/L. The laboratory findings also showed his normal liver, kidney and cardiac functions. His urine K+ excretion rate was normally low as 0.96 of urine K+/Cr ratio (range, 0-2). There were no abnormal laboratory findings to suggest adrenal hormone excess or primary hyperaldosteronism: adrenocorticotropic hormone, 40.11 pg/mL (range, 3.5-13.2 pg/mL); cortisol, 8.7 µg/dL (range, 5.0-23.0 µg/dL); 17 hydroxyprogesterone, 2.68 ng/mL (range, 0.6-3.42 ng/mL); aldosterone, 180.29 pg/mL (range, 38.9-306.8 pg/mL); renin, 6.13 ng/mL/hr (range, 1.31-3.95 ng/mL/hr); epinephrine, 0.030 ng/mL (range, 0-0.30 ng/mL); norepinephrine, 0.087 ng/mL (range, 0-0.80 ng/mL). Thyroid function test (TFT) revealed a hyperthyroidism: serum free thyroxine (fT4), 2.10 ng/dL (range, 0.70-1.48 ng/dL); triiodothyronine (T3), 2.95 ng/mL (range, 0.58-1.59 ng/mL); thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), <0.025 mU/L (range, 0.35-4.94 mU/L). Thus, he was diagnosed as having hypokalemic paralysis due to hyperthyroidim. Serum TSH receptor antibodies were high at 6.05 IU/L (range, 0-1.75 IU/L), thyroid stimulating antibody was positive, and thyroid ultrasonography revealed diffuse enlarged thyroid and increased vascularity. These findings were consistent with Graves' disease as etiology of his hyperthyroidism. He was initially treated with lower dose of an antithyroid drug (methimazole 5 mg once daily) than usual, since his thyrotoxic symptoms and signs were absent, and his level of serum fT4 was not prominent. In addition, a β-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) was simultaneously used for preventing the paralysis. After two weeks, a follow-up TFT revealed aggravated hyperthyroidism, and he was treated with increased dose of antithyroid drugs. After two months, since his heart rate and blood pressure were stable and he had no symptoms of palpitations, β-blockers were discontinued successfully. No paralysis has occurred for one year, as hyperthyroidism can be well controlled with antithyroid drugs ().",What is the patient's body surface area? Please output your answer in terms of m².

He also complained of numbness and a tingling sensation on the left lateral side of the lower leg and dorsum of the foot. At the time of referral, the left leg and foot were soft and non-tender. Only the right dorsalis pedis was pulsatile, but not on the left side. Pain in the left lateral lower leg and dorsum of foot was scored 3/10 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. The Medical Research Council scale for weakness showed the following grades (right/left): hip extension 5/5, knee flexion 5/5, ankle dorsiflexion 5/1, and hallucis extension 5/1. He had no lower back pain and the straight leg raise reached 80° on both sides. A positive Tinel's sign behind the fibular neck on the left side was noted. In a nerve conduction study, there was no compound motor action potential in the left deep peroneal nerve on the left extensor digitorum brevis or tibialis anterior muscle recordings, and no evoked sensory nerve action potential in the left superficial peroneal nerve (). Needle electromyography showed abnormal spontaneous activity at rest and no motor unit action potential activity in the left tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and peroneus brevis muscles (). Computed tomography (CT) angiogram showed proximal occlusion of the left anterior tibial artery (ATA) () without any abnormal findings of the soft tissue. This led to a diagnosis of left common peroneal neuropathy due to occlusion of the left ATA. The patient was treated with oral warfarin.
The patient's medical history was reviewed. He did not have diabetes mellitus. He received a mitral valve replacement 5 years ago due to mitral stenosis, and echocardiography showed a moderate degree of aortic stenosis and regurgitation. In addition, he had complete atrioventricular block and valvular atrial fibrillation; and had a pacemaker inserted three years prior to referral. However, he had been prescribed only an antiplatelet agent because of a history of cerebellar intracranial hemorrhage 2 years previously.
Approximately 4 weeks prior to referral, he visited another hospital suffering from chest pain, and received percutaneous coronary angiography which took about 30 minutes. After percutaneous coronary angiography, he received conservative care in a general ward, without any physical restrain or requirement for absolute bed rest. He could ambulate the ward with only minimal assistance. Some days later, he complained of left leg weakness and a brain CT was performed to rule out an acute brain lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was contraindicated because of the cardiac pacemaker. The brain CT showed a subacute ischemic lesion in the right posterior temporal region but it did not clinically correlate with the weakness. Although he complained of foot drop and paresthesia, there were no symptoms of anterior compartment syndrome such as tenderness, redness or swelling of low leg. No deep vein thrombosis or abnormal findings of soft tissues were found upon ultrasonography of the left leg. After improvement of the chest pain, he was discharged home. Two weeks later he was admitted to the cardiology department in the present hospital due to chest pain, and was referred to the rehabilitation department. After diagnosis of the left common peroneal neuropathy and improvement of the chest discomfort with conservative therapy, he was transferred and received rehabilitation.",What is the patient's body surface area?

764,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-7049766-1,Extracted,"A 31-year-old female patient was referred by her orthodontist to Asan Medical Center in Seoul, Korea for treatment of facial asymmetry and prognathism. The patient had never been diagnosed with a medical problem and had no previous history of fracture. Clinical examination revealed that the patient was slightly short in height (153.4 cm) and moderately overweight (62.4 kg, body mass index [BMI] 26.52 kg/m2). Examination of her facial features revealed a long lower face with vertical maxillary excess and mandibular asymmetry with occlusal canting of the maxilla. In addition, she had upper lip protrusion and lip incompetence.(, ) The intraoral findings included Class III malocclusion with an open bite. She had normal tooth structure and received proper dental care. Therefore, her periodontal health and oral hygiene were good.
After the initial interview, the patient was referred to an orthodontist for leveling and alignment of the teeth, and treatment continued for approximately one year. After the presurgical orthodontic treatment, a clinical evaluation was repeated, and cephalometric radiographs and face bow recordings were obtained for final surgical planning 4 weeks prior to the surgery.
In addition, a work-up for general anesthesia and surgery was performed, and the preoperative hematologic examination, electrocardiogram and chest radiograph were unremarkable.
The surgery included bimaxillary procedures. Le Fort I osteotomy with midline correction, canting correction, posterior impaction, and setback movement of the maxilla were performed via rigid skeletal fixation. Bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomies were performed with a setback movement via the hybrid fixation technique (with one miniplate and one additional bicortical screw). On the left side, a greenstick fracture occurred in the proximal segment. However, we could appropriately position the proximal and distal segments as planned, and so two additional bicortical screws were used to fix the fractured proximal segment. Two closed suction drains were inserted into the mandibular surgical site. The operation was completed without major bleeding, and the estimated blood loss during the surgery was 200 mL.
Abnormal edema and ecchymosis were observed from the second postoperative day.() At first, an improperly functioning closed suction drain was suspected, but the ecchymosis and edema appeared to be bilateral, decreasing the likelihood of drain malfunction. On the second postoperative day, drain removal and maxilla-mandibular fixation (MMF) with elastic ring were routinely performed. Normally, an orthognathic surgical patient is hospitalized for 2 nights and 3 days after surgery, but in this case, the discharge was delayed due to the appearance of abnormal ecchymosis and edema. On the fifth postoperative day, nasal bleeding and transient blood pressure lowering were noted, but the problems resolved after nasal packing and administration of intravenous fluids. At 6 days postoperatively, the patient was stable, and she was discharged from the hospital.
MMF was routinely stopped 2 weeks after surgery, and training elastics were applied. No other complications were observed. However, the ecchymosis persisted for 6 weeks, and although it dissipated slowly and spontaneously, no specific treatment was needed for its resolution. The follow-up examination at postoperative 3 months showed uneventful healing.
During the search for the cause of unexpected postoperative bleeding, she recounted multiple fractures of the lower limbs during childhood, and blue sclera was noticed. Furthermore, her familial history included multiple bone fractures in her mother, grandmother, and cousin. Therefore, OI type I was suspected, and it was inferred that the patient's complications were ultimately caused by bleeding due to vessel fragility from OI.
The postsurgical orthodontic treatment began one month after surgery. The molar and canine relation became Class I, and the open bite was greatly improved. After approximately eight months, debonding was done. The long lower face with vertical maxillary excess and mandibular asymmetry with occlusal canting of the maxilla were greatly improved. The upper lip protrusion and lip incompetence were also improved.(, )","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?

766,62,Adjusted Body Weight,physical,decimal,pmc-7784113-1,Extracted,"RC, a 20-year-old male, sought consult in our institution for small penile size. He was born full-term via normal vaginal delivery to a 35-year-old G3P3 mother, with no perinatal complications. However, there was intake of an abortifacient (4 tablets of misoprostol) on the 5th week of pregnancy. At birth, there was noted “monggo seed” sized penis and “paper-thin” scrotum. His mother was advised by the local health center physician to seek consult with a surgeon however due to financial difficulties, there were no tests nor consult with a specialist done. His childhood and pre-puberty years were unremarkable. There were no symptoms of palpitations, heat or cold intolerance, polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia. There were no episodes of frequent urinary tract infection, dysuria, or abdominal pain. There were no instances of elevated blood pressure, headache, change in vision. There were no significant health problems during his childhood except for appendicitis for which he underwent an emergency appendectomy in July 28, 2008 at Ospital ng Makati.
However, at around 14 to 16 years of age, there was persistence of high pitched voice, scant pubic and axillary hair and fat deposition on waist and bilateral breasts. There was minimal growth in penile size at approximately 2-3 centimeters (cm) and a bilateral palpable scrotal sac.
On physical examination, he was ambulatory with stable vital signs. He is overweight with BMI of 29.09 kg/m2 and weight of 74.5 kilograms. His waist to hip ratio is 0.89 with his waist circumference spanning 86 cm and hip circumference at 96.5 cm. He presented with eunuchoid proportion () with a height of 162 cm and arm span of 171 cms. His mother stands 151 cm while his father at 169 cm with computed mid parental height for boys of 166.5 cm. Thyroid gland was not palpable. He has gynecomastia without galactorrhea (). Genital and pubic hair development was graded as Tanner Stage 1 (). He has a flaccid and stretched penile lengths of 2.5 and 3 cm respectively with width of 4 cm. He has palpable small, firm left testis while non palpable on the right. Neurologic examination was normal except for bilateral anosmia. Evaluation was done by Otorhinolaryngology service which showed recurrent rhinosinusitis. CT scan of paranasal sinuses showed pansinusitis with opacified and widened ostiomeatal units. A trial of steroid therapy was recommended which provided slight relief of anosmia.
Micropenis is defined by Schonfeld and Beebe as Stretched Penile Length (SPL) 2.5 SD less than the mean for age without the presence of any other penile anomalies and presence of internal and external genital organs compatible with a 46 XY karyotype. For an average adult patient, mean stretched penile length is 13.3 cm with 9.3 cm as the calculated 2.5 standard deviation less than the mean for age. The patient has a stretched penile length of 3 cm falling more than 2.5 SD below the mean for adult.
To satisfy the criteria for micropenis, pelvic and inguino-scrotal ultrasound was done to confirm the presence of internal genital organs, which revealed small left testicle measuring 0.9x0.5x0.7 cm with chronic parenchymal changes and a non visualized right testicle. The prostate gland measures 2.2x1.6x1.7 cm (∼3 grams). A whole abdominal CT scan was done with noted left inguinal hernia and ovoid soft tissue density in right inguinal region possibly representing the right testis. Other findings include hepatic steatosis and nephrocalcinosis on the left. Lastly, to satisfy the criteria, chromosome analysis was done revealing a karyotype with no numerical and structural aberrations and an XY sex chromosome complement in all 50 cells examined. Hence the patient has a male karyotype of 46,XY.
However, the patient did not just present with isolated micropenis. Alongside, he has gynecomastia, persistently high pitched voice and underdeveloped adult sexual characteristics. Most authorities accept the definition of delayed puberty as the absence of secondary sexual development at an age 2 SD above the mean age of onset of puberty. This is the age at which 95% of normal children have already entered puberty. Based on etiology, pubertal delay can be classified into constitutional growth delay or hypogonadism. The latter can be further classified into hypogonadotropic or hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.
Though stature is the most obvious change in growth, the ratio of the upper and lower segment also changes significantly. Sex steroids are necessary for increase in growth hormone secretion and they directly stimulate epiphyseal plate’s growth and fusion. In prepubertal hypogonadism, where the growth plates are not yet fused and there is lack of sex steroids, growth plates of the extremities continue to grow past the usual age of cessation. As a result, there is decreased upper to lower ratio and an increased arm span for height leading to eunuchoid proportion like in the patient.
Aside from this, determination of skeletal development by x-ray of left hand and wrist is also a useful way of establishing the stage of physiological development which in some cases may not be parallel with chronological age. The patient has a delayed bone age (compatible to 16 and 5/12 to 14 and 5/12 year old male) by the Greulich-Pyle method (). Estradiol is a product of aromatization of testosterone and it mediates additional effects of testosterone on bone resorption, epiphyseal closure, sexual desire, and fat deposition. From the physical examination and the patient’s bone x-ray, this low estradiol might have contributed to the unfused ossification centers and eunuchoid proportion. Related to this is that androstenedione is converted to testosterone by 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase before it gets aromatized to estradiol. However, androstenedione itself can be aromatized to estrogen which might have contributed to gynecomastia and fat deposition.
The patient’s cranial MRI showed a shallow sella with apparent flattening of pituitary gland at its floor (). The results of baseline endocrine tests are summarized in showing hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (low testosterone, FSH and LH). Other biochemical results are summarized in which showed normal fasting blood sugar, serum sodium, potassium, AST and ALT. While, lipid profile showed normal levels of total cholesterol and triglyceride but elevated LDL.
With these findings, the patient was diagnosed with Primary Empty Sella (PES) (Partial) which is probably congenital based on history of abortifacient use on first trimester of pregnancy, findings of prepubertal hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and MRI showing a partially empty sella.
He was referred to Endocrinology and Urology services. Sex hormone replacement was recommended. He was offered testosterone therapy however this was not yet started due to lack of funds. Steroid was not initiated since serum cortisol is just borderline low and patient is also asymptomatic. Orchiectomy as prophylaxis for development of malignancy is not warranted but orchidopexy may be offered to monitor tumor development.
Counseling was offered regarding possible psychosocial impact of the physical changes brought about by the endocrine problem. Since he has a partner it was also suggested in order to help them regarding possible plans to have children. However, they refused the offer since they’ve already decided to adopt a child in the future. The patient verbalized that currently, the psychical changes has no derogatory impact on his personal and social life.
For continuation of care and surveillance of the possible impact of the hormonal deficiencies on other organ systems, the patient was endorsed to the succeeding endocrinology rotator and outpatient resident. He was last seen on December 2019 and repeat blood chemistries were requested; however, he was lost to follow up thereafter.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?

She had been diagnosed with TA 7 years prior to this presentation. However she refused medications and further evaluation until delivery. Computed tomographic angiography performed 3 years prior had revealed that the left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery were totally occluded along with a thrombotic aneurysm 5.8 × 5.2 × 9.6 cm in size (). She also had a localized dissection in the low abdominal aorta and focal stenosis in the descending aorta as well as a large left coronary aneurysm and about 50% stenosis of the right coronary artery. Plain chest radiographs revealed a huge superior mediastinal mass which was suspected of an aneurysm with thrombus in the left subclavian artery (). Cardiac single photon emission computed tomography and echocardiography were performed preoperatively to follow up on her coronary artery statuses. These examinations showed an old myocardial infarct, a persistent perfusion defect in the basal inferior wall and a reduction in wall motion.
The patient had been diagnosed with Type III TA as determined by the involvement of the aortic arch and coronary artery as well as the descending thoracic and abdominal aortas. She developed dyspnea on exertion with New York Heart Association Functional Class III. On physical examination, peripheral pulsations were weak in all limbs except the right arm. Heart rate was 120 beats/min, and non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) was 96/78 mmHg in the right upper limb and 95/69 mmHg in the left upper limb. NIBP in the lower limbs measured 148/99 mmHg on the right and 156/95 mmHg on the left. She was cooperative and neurological examinations indicated normal results. A slowly titrated epidural anesthesia was selected to maintain hemodynamic stability. Regional anesthesia functioned as a simple and reliable monitor of cerebral perfusion through the patient's level of consciousness. For these reasons, we planned and executed an elective caesarean section under epidural anesthesia.
On arrival at the operating room, we began intraoperative monitoring by electrocardiography, pulse oximetry and NIBP measurement. Electrocardiography was unremarkable with a heart rate of 126 beats/min and the pulse oximeter on her right index finger displayed a normal waveform with a saturation of 95-96% in room air. She was alert and oriented, and her initial NIBP was 113/77 mmHg in the right upper limb. Her left radial, brachial and axillary arteries pulsed feebly, whereas her brachial and axillary arterial pulsations were stronger on the right than on the left. An artery cannula was placed in the right radial artery under local anesthesia connected to a FloTrac™ sensor and Vigileo™ monitor system (Edward Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) device for continuous cardiac output assessments to monitor continuous blood flow. The initial cardiac index was 1.5 L/min/m2. A cerebral oximeter probe (Invos™, Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter 5100C, Somanetics Corporation, Troy, MI, USA) was attached to the forehead. The initial regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) levels were 64% on the right and 51% on the left.
After placing the patient in the left lateral recumbent position, the median approach was performed with loss of resistance technique using an 18 G Tuohy needle between the L4 and L5 lumbar spines. The catheter was inserted and fixed. Her position was then changed to the supine position with a wedge under her right hip. The height of the block was increased gradually to T5 by using 11 ml of 2% lidocaine injected through an epidural catheter. Oxygen was administered via a VentiR mask, and a capnometer was installed below her nose to monitor respiration. The value of rSO2 was stable. Ten minutes after skin incision, a 3,180 gram girl was delivered and her Apgar score was 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.
Three minutes after delivery, the placenta was removed and 20 IU of oxytocin diluted in 1,000 ml of 0.9% saline continued to be intravenously infused. The rSO2 levels dropped from 64 to 61% on the right and from 51 to 39% in the left at 6 minutes after delivery. At that time, we were able to obtain NIBP measurements. Arterial blood pressure was 56/48 mmHg without changes in cardiac index. She complained of dysarthria, tinnitus, and stiffness of the posterior neck (). An intravenous infusion of phenylephrine (100 mcg) and rapid administration of colloid (300 ml over 10 minutes) improved dysarthria, tinnitus and stiffness of the posterior neck as rSO2 increased from 61 to 78% on the right and from 39 to 56% on the left. There was no corresponding change in arterial blood pressure and cardiac index with the increase of the NIBP to 81/71 mmHg. However, she still complained of numbness of the face and blurred vision. Her laboratorial test results were as follows: hemoglobin, 9.0 mg/dl; hematocrit, 26%; Na+, 135 mg/dl; K+, 3.03 mg/dl; and Ca2+, 0.85 mmol/L.
The patient's facial numbness and blurred vision were resolved 20 minutes after the neurologic symptoms developed. Over time, her arterial compliance was reduced and invasive arterial blood pressure waveform damped along with a progressive decline in pulse pressure (). She lost about 1,000 ml of blood and received, in total, 500 ml of colloid solution, 2,500 ml of crystalloid, and 1 unit of blood were infused.
The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for special attention to neurologic symptoms with continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring. Even though no focal neurologic deficits, postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging and a magnetic resonance angiographic study were performed to rule out acute cerebral infarction. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple old infarcts in the right frontal and left frontotemporoparietal areas and a suspicious acute left cerebellar small infarct. In addition, there were complete occlusions of the left subclavian, left common carotid, internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries. There were near-complete occlusions of the bilateral proximal vertebral arteries. The left distal vertebral artery was reconstituted by the left thyrocervical trunk (). She refused further treatments, including surgery. She was discharged on the sixth postoperative day.","Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?

Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 28.0 g albumin/10.0 dL = 2.8 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 28.0 g albumin/L converts to 2.8 g albumin/dL.

He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.
Creatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, HCO3- 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.
His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.
Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.",What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?

The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 135.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 135.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 135.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 135.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 89.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 89.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 89.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 89.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 89.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 89.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 5.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 5.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 5.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 5.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 5.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 5.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 135.0 mEq/L - (89.0 mEq/L + 5.0 mEq/L) = 41.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 41.0 mEq/L.The concentration of albumin is 4.5 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 41.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.5 (in g/dL)) = 39.75 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 39.75 mEq/L.Plugging in 39.75 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 39.75 - 12 = 27.75 mEq/L.

861,67,Albumin Corrected Delta Ratio,lab test,decimal,pmc-4417668-1,Extracted,"A 20-year-old female, unmarried, was admitted via the emergency department of our hospital on 11th December 2013 with complaints of generalized weakness since 2 weeks, difficulty in swallowing since 2 weeks, and loose stools since 5 days. The generalized weakness was gradual in onset and more marked in legs, so much so that she was unable to rise from the bed. She also felt difficulty in swallowing and in subsequent days, difficulty even voiding urine. She also complained of loose stools 4 to 5 times a day, semisolid in consistency. No mucous and no blood was noticed. However, these were associated with occasional abdominal cramps. In systemic inquiry, she did not complain of fever, sore throat, rashes, joint pain, swelling, cough, chest pain, dysuria, hematemesis or backache.
In the past history, she experienced similar episodes intermittently over the last five years. During these episodes, she used to develop generalized weakness, more of lower limbs, vomiting, and sometimes muscle cramps. With these complaints, she often visited doctors and also required admission in private hospitals, where she was given intravenous (IV) fluids with potassium and her weakness improved. Then she was discharged on potassium containing tablets which would relieve her symptoms. After recovery from the episodes, she used to discontinue oral potassium supplements. She used to remain well for 6 to 8 months before she developed another similar episode and treated similarly. In this way, she recalled 4 to 5 admissions. Record of some investigations seen showed that the predominant abnormality was low potassium level in the serum with normal renal functions.
Drug history was remarkable for tablet NeoK, capsule Esomeprazole, multivitamin syrup and tablet motilium. She is the only daughter with two brothers who enjoy good health. No family history of similar disease was elicited. Parents were non-consanguineous. She studied till ninth class and then left study due to the recurrent illness. She was not addicted to narcotics. She had adequate appetite and sleep.
On examination, she had short stature, lean built, and looked wasted and sick. Her pulse was 88 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP), 90/60 mm Hg, temperature, 98.6°F and respiratory rate, 20 breaths per minute. She was not pale looking, icteric or cyanosed. No koilonychia or clubbing was noted. Dehydration was positive, and muscles were wasted.
Her abdomen was soft, non tender, with palpable bladder but no other visceromegaly. The chest was clear. Both heart sounds were audible in all four areas. No added sounds were noted. In central nervous system (CNS) examination, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was15/15; power was 3/5 in both lower limbs, 4/5 in upper limbs with intact sensation. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished in all 4 limbs.
A clinical differential of malabsorption, periodic hypokalemic paralysis, or salt-losing nephropathy was contemplated.
On laboratory investigations, serum urea was 73 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.72 mg/dl; sodium, 127 mEq/L; potassium, 1.4 mEq/L; chloride, 101 mEq/L; and bicarbonate, 09 mEq/L. Her hemogram showed hemoglobin (Hb) of 15.1 g/dl; total leucocyte count (TLC), 37.4×109/L; and platelets, 494×109/L. Urine analysis revealed pH of 7.00; albumin, 2+; pus cells, occasional; and red blood cells (RBCs), numerous. Further biochemical tests showed serum calcium, 6.4 mg/dl; phosphorus, 3.2 mg/dl; serum albumin, 1.8 g/dl; total bilirubin, 0.86 mg/dl; direct bilirubin, 0.08 mg/dl; alkaline phosphatase, 50 IU/L; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), 14 IU/L; serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), 6 IU/L; and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), 7 IU/L.
Ultrasound abdomen showed both sided normal size kidneys with mild pelvicalyceal dilatation bilaterally. Bladder was distended with approximate volume of 430 ml. Chest X-ray was done, which was unremarkable (). Electrocardiography done showed flattening of T waves with occasional inversion in some leads, findings typically seen in hypokalemia ().
She was catheterized, rehydrated with isotonic saline with KCL, and IV antibiotics started on suspicion of urinary tract infection (UTI) as TLC was high. She maintained good urinary output (>1500 ml). By admission day 5, diarrhea had settled. Repeat laboratory tests at this time showed: serum urea of 47 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.6 mg/dl; potassium, 2.5 mEq/L and sodium, 127 mEq/L.
Further investigations showed serum magnesium of 1.02 mg/dl. IV magnesium sulphate was administered daily with modest elevation in serum levels during subsequent days. Potassium requirement remained high and was administered by oral and IV routes. On admission day 10, her serum creatinine was 0.85 mg/dl; potassium, 2.6 mEq/L; and magnesium, 0.95 mg/dl. The temporal changes in serum magnesium and potassium are shown in . The 24-h urinary metabolic study on day 10th of admission showed potassium, 44 mmol/24h; magnesium, 50 mg/ 24 h; calcium, 108 mg/24 h (normal range: 100 to 300 mg/24 h). Fractional excretion of magnesium was 27.3%. In the face of low serum magnesium, fractional magnesium excretion should be less than 2%.
Her gastrointestinal (GI) workup was also done including upper GI endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. Upper GI endoscopy revealed normal mucosa, with mild antral erythema. Sigmoidoscopy showed normal mucosa. Tissue biopsies were also obtained. The duodenal biopsy showed mild stunting of villi with slightly increased intraepithelial lymphocytes; the antrum showed mild chronic nonspecific gastritis and the rectosigmoid, mild nonspecific colitis.
Anti-trangultaminase antibodies and anti-deamidated gliadin-derived peptide antibodies were negative. Final diagnosis was made of GS along with changes of tropical sprue on duodenal biopsy. Genetic testing could not be done due to non-availability of the test.
She was discharged on third January 2014 on tablet spironolactone 25 mg, once daily, increased subsequently to 50 mg; tablet Neok, 2 tablets, 8-hourly, capsule magnesium chloride 1 capsule, 8-hourly, tablet folic acid 5 mg, once daily, tablet Ciproxin 250 mg, 12-hourly. Laboratory tests on 2-week follow up showed serum urea of 15 mg/ dl; creatinine, 0.4 mg/dl; sodium, 142 mEq/L; potassium, 3.6 mEq/L; chloride, 102 mEq/L; bicarbonate, 30 mEq/L; calcium, 8.8 mg/dl; phosphorus, 3.8 mg/dl; albumin, 3.1 g/dl; and magnesium, 1.9 mg/dl.

He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.
On initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.
The patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.
Six months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.",What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?

Hence, The patient's anion gap is 7.0 mEq/L.The concentration of albumin is 1.2 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 7.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 1.2 (in g/dL)) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L.Plugging in 14.0 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 14.0 - 12 = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 2.0 mEq/L.Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 2.0 mEq/L / 6.0 mEq/L = 0.33333. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is 0.33333."
872,67,Albumin Corrected Delta Ratio,lab test,decimal,pmc-6031073-1,Extracted,"A 57-year-old African American male with past medical history of coronary artery disease, systolic heart failure, alcohol abuse, and stage-IV sarcoidosis on long-term oral prednisone at 10 mg daily for over two years presented with massive hematemesis and melena that started the night before his arrival to the Emergency Department. Upon physical examination, the patient appeared pale and was noted to have tachycardia, hypotension, and hematochezia. He denied any recent alcohol intake, chest pain, abdominal pain, and abdominal or rectal trauma. Vital signs consisted of a blood pressure of 84/33 mmHg, heart rate of 118 bpm, room air saturation of 92%, and temperature of 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit (37.1 degrees Celsius). He was admitted to the medical ICU for hypovolemic shock secondary to massive bleeding that required immediate endotracheal intubation for airway protection. An initial blood work showed a hemoglobin count of 13.9 g/dL, white blood cell count of 18.7 K/UL, platelet count of 159 K/UL, sodium of 140 mmol/L, potassium of 3.8 mmol/L, chloride of 101 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 10 mmol/L, calcium of 2.2 mmol/L, albumin of 2.7 g/dL, CRP of 233 mg/L, ESR of 36 mm/hr, BUN of 17 mg/dL (6.07 mmol/L), creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL (132.6 Umol/L), lactic acid of 17.0 mmol/L, BNP of 1140.63 pg/ml, total bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL, troponins of 0.020 ng/mL, and CK-MB of 408 ng/mL. Resuscitation was initiated with administration of isotonic solutions, blood transfusions, and initiation of vasoactive medications, and pantoprazole drip was provided. An initial urgent endoscopy revealed a bleeding Dieulafoy lesion, which was immediately clipped. Acute kidney injury was addressed with aggressive fluid resuscitation as evident by increase in BUN of 33 mg/dL (11.78 mmol/L) and creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL (256.33 Umol/L). CT scan of abdomen performed to rule out ischemic colitis in the setting of progressive abdominal distention showed a diffuse pericolonic inflammation most pronounced at the rectosigmoid colon. Repeat endoscopy showed multiple ulcerated lesions of the gastric mucosa () with a biopsy that revealed necrotic debris with acute leukocytic exudate and numerous variably sized, 90-degree angulated fungal hyphae favoring mucormycosis (). Intravenous liposomal amphotericin-B (5 mg/kg/day at 60 kg weight) was started at a dose of 300 mg daily. Due to deterioration of renal function on the second day, treatment was switched to oral suspension of posaconazole at a dose of 400 mg twice a day for a total of 6 days (of note, no levels of posaconazole were drawn during hospital course). Repeat CT scan of the abdomen showed mild-to-moderate hydroureter with hydronephrosis and bladder wall thickening Figures and . Cystoscopy showed distorted anatomy of bladder lumen with multiple mounds of tissues all throughout the bladder most notable in the trigone with failure to locate ureteral orifices. Random biopsies taken from the bladder tissue also showed necrotic debris with active inflammatory and numerous variably sized angulated fungal hyphae consistent with Mucorales species. Once bladder biopsy confirmed Mucor spp, treatment was switched from posaconazole to intravenous isavuconazonium sulfate at a dose of 372 mg every eight hours for 48 hours as loading dose and then to an oral dose of 372 mg daily. Unfortunately, no sensitivity of the isolate to the newer triazoles was available. Surgical approach was considered; however, given patient's frail state and multiple comorbidities, such approach was deferred. Hydronephrosis significantly improved after placement of bilateral nephrostomy tubes. In addition, continuous bladder irrigation with amphotericin-B was given for localized bladder infection for a total of 5 days. A three-way Foley catheter was inserted for continuous amphotericin-B bladder irrigation where 200 ml of medication was administered via catheter; then, the catheter was clamped for 90 minutes and drained to gravity every six hours. After three weeks of systemic treatment with antifungals, a third endoscopy showed only inflammatory changes with a pathologic report, in which mucormycosis was no longer appreciated. His kidney function improved and remained stable after clamping and removal of his nephrostomy tubes. The patient completed 6 months of therapy with 372 mg of oral isavuconazonium sulfate per day. He is currently at home with resolution of his symptoms and no clinical evidence of relapse after 12 months since completion of his treatment.",What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.,"{'Chloride': [101.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Albumin': [2.7, 'g/dL'], 'Bicarbonate': [10.0, 'mmol/L'], 'Sodium': [140.0, 'mmol/L']}",1.44643,1.37411,1.51875,"The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).
To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.
The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 140.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 101.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 101.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 101.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 101.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 101.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 101.0 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 10.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 10.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 10.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 10.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 10.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 10.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 140.0 mEq/L - (101.0 mEq/L + 10.0 mEq/L) = 29.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 29.0 mEq/L.The concentration of albumin is 2.7 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 29.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 2.7 (in g/dL)) = 32.25 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 32.25 mEq/L.Plugging in 32.25 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 32.25 - 12 = 20.25 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 20.25 mEq/L.Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 20.25 mEq/L / 14.0 mEq/L = 1.44643. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is 1.44643."
